0511189877,"We had an old Time Warner Cable remote that was dropped into a bucket of dirty mop water.  We dried it out and it seemed to work &#34;fine&#34; except for the few times one of the batteries began to sizzle and smoke and became hotter than anything I had ever felt before and literally burned a hole in our couch upholstery.  Needless to say, this remote, the CLIKR-5, is awesome, easily programmed, and works perfectly with our TWC equipment and all the other A/V components.  I love this remote... great product.  (Probably goes without saying, but just in case, you don't get the TWC logo on it.)",Electronics
0511189877,It is an exact duplicate of my Time warner remote.I bought it so my wife could control the TV from her chair and not ask me to do it every time.It works great.I would reccomend it to anyone.,Electronics
0511189877,Works just like the rental unit supplied by the cable company.  In fact it is identical.  Just what I was looking for.,Electronics
0511189877,Exactly like what I had and wanted. Works great so far,Electronics
0511189877,This remote was easy to program and operates all the features on Time Warner including On Demand. My TV is a Samsung and it took about 5 minutes. Be sure to write down your codes for future reference!,Electronics
0511189877,"Just like the one from the cable company, but without the $3 monthly billing!",Electronics
0511189877,Came but you have to press on the buttons hard for it to work,Electronics
0511189877,"As others said: works as well or better than original. If you've lost or broken yours, or if like mine some of the buttons just stopped responding, this is a great replacement - especially at this price.",Electronics
0528881469,"This is a great truck GPS. I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.    Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.    I'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.    My complaints are relatively minor:    Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.    The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.    There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.    Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.    [[ASIN:0528881469 Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS]]",Electronics
0528881469,"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\\"" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7\\"".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\\"" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\\"" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:                                                  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),                                2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).                                                                     3) large 7\\"" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving                                                                                   4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.                                                                5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \\""Construction Ahead\\"" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.                                                                                                  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.                                                        7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.                                                                             8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.                                                                                                       9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route                                  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)       11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)                                                             12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)        13) ittells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.                                                                                                                14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.   Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.",Electronics
0528881469,"I have owned two Rand McNally GPS devices over the last two years. Buyer beware! They are pieces of junk. The software is great, but the hardware does not last. The first GPS lasted a year. I spent another $400, that one lasted about 14 months. If you don't mind spending $400 a year for a GPS buy one. Otherwise do not buy it it is the worst and most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. I still use my original GARMIN I purchased in 2006.",Electronics
0528881469,"We had the GPS for quite a while with a minimal amount of problems.  The plug in port bent but Rand McNally replaced it.  We puchased the new TND720 and gave the TND700 to our driver.  Well, our ex driver - he was technologically challenged and let the until hang off the dash on a trip from KY to TX. When I told him to secure it to the dash, he threw it in the storage department above the dash, thus the ex employee,<br /><br />I highly recommend the Rand McNally.  Rand McNally provides an excellent product and excellent support.",Electronics
0528881469,"Thought the unit was going to be a good unit, but was I wrong very wrong. The unit has a bad probleum with the 12 volty pulg in. They replaced the unit once in 6 months and the second unit last about 8 months before it started giving me trouble, but would they stand behind it NO NO NO. They said it had been over a year since I had bought the first unit so it was not covered.  The person I talked with at the Tec centered knew very well what I was talking about. If I made something that cost as much and made claims of how great a unit it was I would stand behind it and if I knew of probleums with the 12 plug in I would come up with a fix.  So take your chances if you buy one from Rand McNally hope it last for you but I have my doughts. Have a friend this last week his started have the same probleum so I told him he had better send it in.",Electronics
0528881469,"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \\""trucker\\"" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!",Electronics
0528881469,I bought this product to use primarily for work. I log 3200+ mile a week and thought this would be a good to tool to have. I love the graphics. There were a few times that it routed me thru some residential areas and a couple of times I wondered if a truck was even legal at all. I loved the feature where I could see if there was a truck stop or rest area close by though it does not have them all. My main concern or problem with this device is in the charging port. The unit get to hot at this port. I went thru 3 12vlt chargers and 1 house wall charger. eventually the plug in had got to the point of being brittle and fell apart. I talk to Rand McNally about this they sent me 1 12 volt charger. But I had to pay for the rest and if I wanted them to look at it I would have to pay shipping out of my pocket. I have a problem with that because I paid so much for it to start. I had it about 2 mos. when it started having problems. I had it 10 mos. when it finally became useless and I thrrew it away. I replaced it with the rand Mcnally 510. It's a whole different animal with a whole lot more problems and will be taken back today.,Electronics
0528881469,"DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT MY CELL PHONE GIVES ME BETTER DIRECTIONS AND FASTER ROUTES TO MY DESTINATION EVEN THOUGH ITS MAINLY A CAR ROUTE. RAND MCNALLY TND 700 HAS GOTTEN ME IN SEVERAL TIGHT SPOTS INCLUDING NON TRUCK ROUTES THAT I HAD TO BACK UP MY TRACTOR TRAILER IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE.   THIS PRODUCT ALSO CANNOT READ MAPS CORRECTLY. IT HAS TOLD ME TO MAKE U TURNS AND GO SOUTH FOR 3 MILES TO CATCH A BY PASS ROUTE TO GET ON I 95  WHEN ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CONTINUE STRAIGHT FOR ABOUT 800 FEET AND MAKE A LEFT TO THE I95 ON RAMP.     THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. AND IHAVE TRIED TO CONTACT AMAZON SO THAT I CAN RETURN THIS PRODUCT AS IT REALLY SUCKS. NOW ITS FEATURES LIKE MILEAGE TRACKING BY STATE AND DAY TRAVELED ITS GREAT, BUT WHAT GOOD ARE ITS FEATURES WHEN YOU CANT GET TO YOUR DESTINATION ON TIME OR GET LOST BY THE SAME INSTRUMENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ELIMINATE JUST THAT.",Electronics

0594296420,Good product.,Electronics
0594296420,Works as expected.,Electronics
0594451647,This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:<br /><br />- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.<br />- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.<br />- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.<br />- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.<br /><br />Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.<br /><br />Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,Electronics

You pause the movie and it pops back up on the TV screen.",Electronics
0594451647,"Great to be able to hook your nook up to TV and watch netflix, hbo-go, etc on it.  Cord could be a bit longer, but works okay - just have to have nook close to the tv.",Electronics
0594451647,"It's cool for my tablet to hook up to my tv, I just hate that it is not fully widescreen on my tv. I also do not like the short cord which means the tablet basically has to be over there on the tv stand with the tv, and also the plug comes out of the tablet very easily if moved.... But these are the breaks I guess. I have had no issues with playback, its good just poorly designed.",Electronics
0594451647,happy i can stream from my Nook. works great.,Electronics

0966185056,"This DVD is a little strange at times. It's cute enough considering I bought it USED for around $2. But if you're going to have to pay  much more than that...don't. Some parts are cute, some are just wierd looking.",Electronics
0966185056,"Oh boy. still images of Christmas cards, mall santas, Christmas trees, toys, and decorations with musical background. The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk!",Electronics

0966185056,"I love Christmas videos and music, but I usually read and/or inquire about the material -- whatever it is -- before I purchase it; inevitably, sales for this particular dvd would increase if more particulars were given  regarding its contents. Shame.",Electronics
0966185056,This is a must see for the X-mas season.  It is a tradition in our family to play this movie while we are setting up our tree and decorating our home for the holidays.  When you can't always see the TV screen to see the beautiful X-mas scenery we can still hear the wonderful holiday music playing.  It along with our other holiday movies are played often throughout the month of December.,Electronics
0966185056,"I can only imagine that those who gave this video 4 or 5 stars must be somehow receiving a share of the profits. I feel completely robbed--you know, that kicked in the gut feeling you get when you realize you've been suckered! There is almost nothing here visually but still images, none of them particularly interesting or poignant. In fact most are simply tacky. Wreaths on somebody's front door, a local mall's Christmas decorations. A house with a light display no more impressive than my neighbor's. Photographs, I kid you not, of Christmas cards. Not one or two, but sequences of dozens--none of them very appealing or interesting. This \\""video\\"" seems to have been made by someone who just drove around town for a few days and took pictures of anything and everything even vaguely related to Christmas. It may be good for shut-ins who can't make it to the mall to see what The Gap or Limited II has put in it's windows. It's like an annoying colleague who insists you look at his Christmas pictures and gushes over them as you think to yourself, so what?",Electronics
0966185056,"This is a very thorough, relaxing Christmas-season video.  It's a true &quot;classic&quot; that has been around for 15 years.  I mostly agree with &quot;pianistcritic's&quot; earlier review here, except that I found Steve Amerson's rendition of &quot;Is There a Place?&quot; to be quite excellent and very appropriate for the CHRISTmas season.  He was one of the song's composers.  If lip-sync was used, it was done tastefully.  This is a MUST HAVE video which I find is excellent for gift-giving.  You'll play it every year!  It really gives you the Christmas spirit!",Electronics

097185548X,I have enjoyed listening to the Financial Peace 13 lessons CD by Dave Ramsey. A lot of the information he covers in the lessons I have heard over the years on his radio program. This has been a great way to refresh my memory on several of the things I already know and practice. I have also gained some new information I didn't know about retirement investing and insurance. I am very pleased with my purchase.,Electronics

097185548X,"AWESOME SELLER, DEAL & CONTENT! I've listen to Dave Ramsey and he is THE BEST! I bought Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University for myself and I bought a second one for a family member (they weren't getting mine...I just couldn't part with it). Dave Ramsey's CD's and program are easy listening and totally do-able!<br /><br />My family member was a die-hard instant gratification/impulse spender and now I'm happy to say has listened to Dave Ramsey and has implemented Dave's strategies. I'm not talking about a kid here, this person is in his mid-fifties and has had this unconscious spending mindset all of his life. From the very first Dave Ramsey CD that he popped into his car CD player, he was hooked! He even looked forward to repetitive listening of each CD several times to have it become ingrained in his memory before moving on to the next one...very cool!<br /><br />His transformation is amazing! He's turned his life around to be a financial wizard and has learned how to accelerate getting out of debt years sooner than he otherwise would have done.<br /><br />He's so much more financially responsible with his retirement planning/investment funds/insurance policies and especially of conscious spending of his money. He's become a very smart shopper that recognizes the difference between \\""wants\\"" and \\""needs\\"" and if it's not a \\""need\\"" he doesn't \\""want\\"" it.<br /><br />Best of all, he's not stressed out over doing it. He's actually happy and looks forward to finding different ways of saving money. It's so fun to carry on a financial conversation because there is no more tension and frustration that goes with it. Instead, he lights up and even initiates conversations regarding finances. I never thought I would ever see the day when that would happen, so thank you very much Dave Ramsey! A million times thank you!<br /><br />You won't regret buying any of Dave Ramsey's programs...you'll only regret it if you don't!  :D",Electronics

You really need (on my unit at least) to work it for a while before installing so you don't have to put so much stress on the mounts once installed. It was VERY stiff and took quite a bit of muscle to loosen it up enough to adjust...even with the adjusters loosened for this purpose...suppose it's better to have it too tight than loose and have the tv \\""drift\\"" around.

But when I received a gift card this spring, I thought, \\""This is going to be spent on something I wouldn't blow my own money on but I want.\\""  I knew I didn't want a Kindle because of both the issues of \\""locked in\\"" book buying and no way to use extra storage (SD card), so I started reading about the Nooks and settled on the Tablet.<br /><br />I am in love!

I didn't buy it for an iPad substitute, but I really do use the browser a lot more than I expected to check email, read some of my discussion forums, etc.  And the convenience of the device, and esp. of using the Overdrive service to borrow ebooks for free and without having to leave the house, has me back to my favorite hobby that I've been away from for years--READING!<br /><br />Highly, HIGHLY recommend!",Electronics
1400532620,Do not buy a Nook!!!! Spend you money else where. We have both a color and a black and white. Both are less than a year old and have had to be replaced already. Now the B&W needs to be replaced again. Tech support is a joke!!! In store support is just a little better-if there is a store close to you. Would never buy one again-company will not refund. BAD NEWS!!!!,Electronics

1400532620,Well the nook serves its purpose well. It is great in high levels of bright sun light and even does well in the shade. Battery life is amazing and the nook library is defiantly growing. Love the whole idea of narrowing books from friends and your local library.,Electronics

1400532620,"Last month, my Nook became completely pixilated and unreadable... got a replacement, same thing happened within 3 weeks. B&N is replacing it, but will not let me pay the difference to get a Nook color. I do NOT recommend the standard Nook, as I've had two defective devices in less than a month.     I appreciate their willingness to replace the device, but am very frustrated by the defects, and the fact that they will not allow me to exchange it (and pay the difference!) for a Nook Color, when clearly the standard Nook is a subpar product.",Electronics
1400532620,"This was my first e-reader, and remains my favorite.  I am a huge fan of e-ink, and enjoy the look of reading from paper.  It is very simple to use, and books can be easily side-loaded with the free Calibre software.  Page turn time is quick, but quicker with the newer version.  Battery life does last about two weeks, reading a pace of at least one to two hours per day.  Battery is only consumed when the color screen is on or when pages are turned.<br /><br />Of course, as a Prime customer, I really need a Kindle :)",Electronics
1400532620,"I selected the black and white NOOK over the Kindle because I can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the NOOK.  We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.    The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.    While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.    The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.  It really doesn't have the horsepower for that.",Electronics
1400532655,"The reviews so far are really good, so I dont need to add more on the actual features. Now did you know that buying directly from B & N, the Nookcolor is actually $249? Also, for those who are concerned about the lcd, dont worry. You can adjust the brightness level. I lower it when I read at night in the dark, and when its daylight and I want more clarity, I can brighten it. You can use literature published in so many digital formats (but not amazon kindle format, which doesnt play well with others), and its just a pleasure to use. Someone mentioned that when you have it plugged for charging and try to type on the keyboard, it doubles the characters. Yeah, been there, done that, true story, so hopefully as they update the software, that will improve, but once you unplug, everything seems to work very nicely. If you want a nice reading environment, I really would recommend the nook color. It makes reading such a pleasure, at a very decent price for the product you are buying. I actually like that it has a tiny bit of \\""weight\\"" to it. Now my little droid incredible, which had been my reader til I got the NookColor, feels so...light! Almost TOO light! And...it LOOKS so elegant. I actually prefer having the plastic/metal (not sure what it is actually, but it feels nice and looks nicer) bezel as opposed to the ipad glass to the edge type construction. It gives me a nice place to put my fingers. And get a nice cover for it. B & N has some very nice ones. Yes, some are a bit pricey, but I really think its worth the investment. Mine already has fallen to the carpeted ground when my dog figured I had been reading long enough, and wanted some attention. I was very glad I had it in a cover. However, with the bezel and the rubberized back, I dont think I would have had a heart attack if it fell uncovered. I would never risk that, but it looks and feels as though it could take a bit of a tumble without much trouble, at least onto carpet. It just seems less fragile than the ipad or galaxy tab.  The book collections are extensive, and I also had quite a collection of pdf books which I very easily downloaded. And I LOVE the free trial for the magazines. To discontinue any of them you decide you dont want, you have to log into your online nook account on the B $ N website, and find the \\""manage subscriptions\\"" link. Took me a minute to figure that out, so hopefully that tidbit will save you some frustration. But overall, its a wonderful, colorful, very nice user experience. Its an ereader first and foremost, and it does that very well. It just happens to have a few lil extra goodies tossed in to boot! Dont compare it to the ipad. It isnt supposed to BE the ipad! Let it have its own little niche, and I promise you will be as happy with it as I am!",Electronics

NC is well made, arrived in like-new condition, reliable, responsive and by booting to full Android (with the dual-boot micro-SD) it is a real tablet with full access to the Android market. Only cons are lack of microphone or camera, but for a total cost of <$180 it's awesome!  Good battery life, beautiful screen, responsive and a really excellent reader (especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use).  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email, RSS, games and reading, including pdf books and Netflix movies.  If you have an Android phone, using this is the same with a much better screen.  It's a really good tablet as is, but with the dual-boot MSD card it is an awesome deal!",Electronics
1400532655,"I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.  Good:  Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.  Bad  minor complaints):  that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.  Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.  UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.  UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.    Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.

140053271X,"The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)  All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add \\""epub download\\"" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)",Electronics
140053271X,"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.<br /><br />First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.<br /><br />Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.<br /><br />Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.<br /><br />Fourth the buttons are all well placed.<br /><br />Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.<br /><br />Go try one today.

140053271X,"I love the B&N Nook Simple Touch.  I can't compare it to the Amazon Paperwhite, because I refuse to try one.  The Nook has expandable memory (which I do not believe the Paperwhite does).  Up to 32GB, which means I can save around 32,000 books.  If, for some reason, I need more space, then I can just drop another 15-20 bucks, and have another 32GB (though I will have my collection split over two memory cards).  I also like that B&N accepts ePub, which is pretty much the universal standard, whereas Amazon locks you into their own store.  This means that you can shop Sony's store with a Nook, and Nook's store with a Sony, but Amazon can't access either of those stores.<br /><br />The downside to this is that, as of now, Amazon books tend to be cheaper than any other e-reader store.  However, all the ebooks are usually within a dollar or two, and I like having the freedom to go and purchase e books from multiple stores, instead of just being locked into one.<br /><br />This is NOT a tablet, and as such, you can't surf the web, download apps, or play games.

1400599997,"I spent months going back and forth on the e-reader idea and researched the Nook, Kindle, and some others like the Kobo.  I was really set on the Kindle but after reading some more about the Barnes & Noble Nook it really clicked with me.  I liked the idea of a user-accessible battery, and the formats that are compatible with this e-reader.  The B&N ebook library had a much larger selection at the time and of books i was really wanting that I couldn't find on amazon.  At first the touch screen seemed ridiculous and somewhat pointless, this caused me to really lean towards the Kindles as I figured it would really drain the battery and was more of a gimmick than a necessary part of the device. BUT after using the Nook it just makes navigation quick and awesome, totally won me over and I hope on the next gen they don't decide to do away with the touch screen.  You can set it to shut off when not in use for a few seconds and the battery lasts quite a long time.  When the touch screen is off it still works to turn pages.  You just swipe your finger across the dark screen, pages turn, it's quite nice.    E-readers in general didn't click with me, didn't think I'd really use it as anything more than a \\""toy of the week,\\"" but after the first 2 weeks my Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too).  Navigating the bookstore is incredibly simple and I LOVE being able to read reviews online with it for books and making wishlists.  Finding selections of free ebooks is a snap.  The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it.  It is definitely superior to trying to read on an lcd screen.  Being able to change text size is also a huge plus (pretty standard on all ereaders, just stating my love for the option).  I haven't had a single software/hardware problem at all so that is great.  The only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories/folders (unless you can and I just don't know how).      Supposedly you can link up to 5 Nooks to one account so they can all share the same library of ebooks you've purchased so now I'm trying to get my family members to buy Nooks as well!

It has a pretty decent battery life (I'd recommend airplane mode unless you're actually downloading), is super simple to load books/documents from a computer, and looks/feels great. I'm currently in law school, and have numerous PDFs from various classes loaded onto it. Reading from an eReader is way easier on the eyes than constantly staring at a computer screen (and it costs the same as a single casebook).     I like the Nook's touchscreen interface; it can be a little slow at times, but I haven't had any major issues with it. One of my biggest factors for buying a Nook over a Kindle/Sony was that Barnes & Noble is a BOOKSELLER. This device is designed with book readers in mind. The fact that I can loan eBooks from the library, read eBooks for free while at Barnes & Noble, and the overall design of the thing (multiple options for turning pages, I like to swipe the touchscreen vs. pushing the buttons) put the Nook far out in front. The fact that Barnes & Noble gives you 2 weeks to try the thing out put it over the edge. I initially bought the Wi-fi only version and it froze after the second day, I exchanged it for the Wi-fi/3G at the store no questions asked.

I know some people may not care about auto hyphenation but it is very important for me as I prefer reading in larger font size. The ebook readers of other brands may be good in other respects but cannot display text as beautifully as Nook GlowLight does, especially when I use larger font size. The reason I have given it four stars is because the light is not even enough on the top of the page.
