{"text":" Bluebuds X by Jaybird are wireless and self-charging . Same price at my Best Buy as at Amazon ($124) Highly recommend these for the sound quality at this price point . Buy them if you're only using them for TV and want wireless . Buy these for an elderly person who needs help hearing thier TV .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable works great for Xbox 360 and Panasonic Viera TH-42PX80U (42-720p HDTV) It's solidly built and it's digital, so there's little opportunity for poor performance . The end of the cable broke off one day switching it from my Playstation to my dvd player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The swing arm, while feeling stiff at first, really breaks in nicely once the weight of the TV is on it . It pulls out enough from the wall to turn the TV a full 90* in each direction . Amazon rejected my first review of this product where I stated I received the wrong product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The $30 mount is the worst one I've purchased, by far the worst . The tilt feature is non--existant\u00a0to be used to hold the TV in a specific position, support them with a little block of wood . The included level is junk, so make sure you have a quality one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 Feet) - Category 2 via Amazon.com . The value of the product is excellent and the delivery accuracy was flawless . The response time is so much faster then the regular component cables on my xbox 360 . The only complaint about this cable is that it is quite thick .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only reason you didn't get 5 stars is your mounting technique, you have to lift the TV up to the mount and screw in to the plate at the same time . The only down side was not having the correct size bolts to mount it to the back of our 32&#34; Samsung LED .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic RO-HJE120-K are the best yet in inexpensive earbuds . The sound quality barely surpasses the quality of ones purchased from the Dollar Store . They block ambient sound out too well so my coworkers have a hard time getting my attention . The quality of sound is average, but this device has good bang for buck .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable was purchased to replace another HDMI cable that was going bad . The cable keeps randomly dropping the connection for a few seconds . This results in the monitor briefly blanking out until the connection is re-established . The design on these were not compatible with samsung galaxy note tablet with an otter box case .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Leaf 50 is made out of better materials and also includes an amplifier that I discovered I don't need . Location of the antenna is the biggest factor how good of reception you will get . The Leaf is for people living less than 35 miles from the TV transmitter . The only channels that are less than 100% are PBS channel A., 50% and 75% channels .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AmazonBasics 2 - Pack, High - Speed HDMI Cables 6 . 5 feet work great on the Sony playstation ps3 . The color-coded ends make it easier to sort if you have lots of wires behind your gear . The only HDMI cables that will outlast 6 months of use are the Amazon-Basics ones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Bose SoundLink Mini has a 1\/2 lb speaker that can easily fill up the entire room . The tonality of spoken voices is neutral and this speaker doesn't try to outperform for its size . The only negative is that it costs so much . The battery life is too short and the charging cradle and the adapter cannot be charged via USB .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DKnight Magicbox Magicbox Ultra-Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker works well, especially for the price of $30 . Bluetooth works great, connects to devices quickly and with no interference, the quality of music is good . Sound isn't bad for a small thing, but for people who really enjoy listening to good quality music sound, this might not be the right choice .","product_category":"Electronics"}
