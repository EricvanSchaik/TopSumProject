{"text":" The CLIKR-5 is an exact duplicate of my Time Warner Cable remote . It is easy to program and operates all the features on Time Warner including On Demand . If you've lost or broken yours, or if like mine some of the buttons just stopped responding, this is a great replacement .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth\/Cat engine . Exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely . Announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you) what state you are in and\/or going into .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a must for the Barnes and Noble Simple Touch Ereader . Don't buy just by the picture displayed, make sure to read the description . I am still missing the USB cable, but I'm happy to charge my nook anywhere, no need for pc.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place . It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you . The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk! A rich repertoire of beautiful Christmas music with various and numerous scenes of holiday symbols and events . Some parts are cute, some are just wierd looking .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a wonderful read and present . It changed so many lives around me including my own . This has been a great way to refresh my memory on several of the things I already know and practice . I have also gained some new information I didn't know about retirement investing and insurance .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The installation was simple but mounting the actual TV wasn't . You have to lift and hold the TV up so as to align the holes for the screws . Once up, the Tv leans to the left . The mount was installed level and the first arm is level but the second arm is not .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Nook pales in comparison to both the Kindle and the Ipad and I regret purchasing it . The convenience of the device has me back to my favorite hobby that I've been away from for years--READING! The ability to adjust the sizing of the words is what sold me .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This was my first e-reader, and remains my favorite . Battery life does last about two weeks, reading a pace of at least one to two hours per day . Battery is only consumed when the color screen is on or when pages are turned . Nook Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Amazon lists the NOOKcolor for over $300 but it's available at barnesandnoble.com for $249 + tax (~$269) The Nookcolor is heavier than the Kindle but lighter than the iPad . It is NOT a standard USB charger, so you cannot buy an off-the-shelf charger .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book . All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate . But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too) The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it . Only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories\/folders .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The pages turn fast and seamless, and I have never had an issue with it lagging . For people debaiting between this and a Kindle, defenitely choose Nook . They give you the ability to lend many titles, you can read any book for free .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product came in on time, included batteries, and is in perfect working condition . The screen is useless unless you really need to be reminded of what button you just pressed . The company even makes a smartphone app that does this because everyone already owns a device that is capable of what this does .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The magnetic washer that is used to manage clicks, is not attached to the box and I lost it somehow . The instructions aren't the most useful, but I used this YouTube video to help me put it together . It can get a little uncomfortable on the nose, but adding some padding (paper towel or the like) should fix that .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Google Glass is a great product but it may cause some problems in the eyes . The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger) I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure . The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best deal anywhere, product is exactly as described and works well! You cannot beat this price . The cable works, I don't see any problems with it, and it is a bunch cheaper than I could get from Best Buy . The audio is not interrupted, but the video goes blank every 10 seconds for 3-4 seconds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DB9 Male\/Female null model is great product for the money! It works and can fit in any computer bag without taking a space as standard cable would do! The missing pin 9 is normal for almost all null modem adapters . The quality of this null modem adaptor is invaluable. It is in itself a shrine to the quality of life .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is everything it is supposed to be and works just as well as much more expensive cables . It is easy to install and makes everything look good on tv . The cable works fine for what i needed and saved me money . Ide buy it again. It does its job .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The EZGrabber2 works well but it's software is a little lack luster . The product website doesn't even list this version of the product amongst its legacy products . It apparently needs a new driver but no one has . It doesn't have the best video capture even with the newest VHS tapes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The music and graphics stink . The only thing good about it is that it works . The graphics on the pad is better than the graphics on T.V. It looks like a Arcade game from the 70's . The positive is that you get a really good work-out. Make sure you wear a pair of socks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit isn't the most compact but is very tranformer like to accomodate multiple outlet configurations . The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This product is garbage. Had issues from the start, then at the end it came apart . Feels and looks cheap . Even though it came in a Samsung package it makes me want to think that is a cheap Chinese copy . It worked as advertised, but the cheap plastic around the USB end keeps breaking .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The shipping packaging was great and the cable came intact . The cable is a cheep cable, but you get what you pay for . The picture is not what there say for the quality of the cable . The HDMI 1.4 cable for a 3D hd, but got it, pretty quick tho, the label says version 1.3 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" HDMI cable is very good for short money, the pictures in HD through the HDMI cable are wonderful . Product has functioned properly with my Canon T2i for six months now . The cable has had no problems after six months of general use (probably has been used twenty times)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a great buy at a great price and I would highly recommend it . The HDMI cable that Canon endorsed was a bit pricey . This alternative is a good, cheaper choice . It works exactly as expected . Couldn't beat it for the price. Very satisfied with my purchase .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to . There is a delay of few seconds when I switch from the camera viewfinder to the TV but I hardly think this has to do with the cable . It looks as good as the the Canon one in terms of build quality .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The small end of the cable is not the same as pictured and does not fit the port on my tablet . The cable works great, has excellent picture quality and is very light . It may work for you but it didnt work for me. The cable does not work at all with my Asus Eee Slider or my Arcos Tablet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It is easy to connect my Camcorder to my TV and provides the desired results . It arrived in a very timely manner . Shipping was fast too . It works fine . Plugs into what I want like it should . I use this for  something, but forget where .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price was right and I get it right time !!!!! I would recommend this to all the people that I know . Good cheap long cable that actually backs up most of the capabilities . The 3-d came in a little shadowy and the Ethernet signal would not either .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product did not fit my Galaxy Tab2 - so I may have mis-understood the product listing thinking . Vendor took friendly, immediate action and solved the mistake for me . It work fine with my Coby tablet very good reception. But it was not work with my Galaxy tab 2  7.0 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The video works great but no audio. Had to add another wire for the audio. The resolution is terrible and will not always work. I want to return it for a full refund but have no means of contacting the seller through Amazon. The delivery was on time and the cable was easy to connect.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This item was exactly what I was looking for to play back my pictures on a high def TV . The cable works flawlessly . For the price it is great. I am looking forward to viewing movies in the future from my television . I have not seen the &#34;original&#36;, but I am very satisfied with this .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The company that sold this to me (A Days Tech) claimed that this was a genuine Samsung product on the Amazon listing . It simply was NOT the device that was being shown in the image, but a really crappy knock off that worked maybe half the time with my TV's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The old company either went bankrupt or sold out, but RCA has run this product into the ground . The wood handle is imprecisely cut so that the bottle no longer fits well inside . The old model had ridges of material that ran lengthwise to the handle, with the fibers angled so that they dug into the grooves and pulled out the dust, holding onto it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of the tapes was extraordinarily crisp and clear . The tapes were defective at the end of side A \/ beginning of side B, just like the Sony 120 min tapes . FRED K. WILLDERS: \"I like my music with me always, it's better than online\"","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best normal bias for Maxell is the UDXL I in the blue silver case If one can still find it . NOS is a bit overpriced and not worth the price . These are quiet tapes and don't produce any noise . If it is sold online for more than you are getting a rip off .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a very good product, these cassettes have many purposes, you can record music, record lectures, or any thing else . The batterys will do they were a little low on the power at 2.78 volts . Used to make mixtapes for her older car with a tape deck .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" XLII-90 audio cassettes are great for recording and playback of records, compact discs, and other sources where a very low-noise, high-quality cassette is needed . Unfortunately, these are no longer being manufactured . The tapes have too much drag in the mechanism .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell XLII high bias tapes are highly durable, long lasting, and play back very clear sound . A 5-pack of 90 minutes cassettes hold's a large amount of music . The construction of the casing is far stronger than most cassettes . The music from a Cassette is more alive and vibrant .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes . The audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side of the cassette deck . The better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a digital file .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Package was simple to open....no scissors or knife needed! Instructions were simple and easy to follow! Product is as described . Product works as expected . Would not be easy to use on a Philips DVD Recorder . Horrible Mistake!!! It must have screwed up the lens alignment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell cases are well made and reassemble easily . They are available here at Amazon for a very fair price . The reason I need them is because such an event is so rare is because of the rare occurrence of it happening so rare . It was below $1 per pack, not counting shipping, but $9.99 still isn't bad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The disc did not work in my car . Has not had any problems since . Does a very good job of cleaning the heads of your DVD player? How can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your DVD players?  Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is more 'mid-rangy' to me than balanced . There's some bass but not a lot, and likewise with the treble . The speakers in the HP-200 don't adjust their angle at all to accommodate the listener's ears, so you always feel as if they could just sat a wee bit better when wearing them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fits well and the inline volume control is great . The earbuds fill very well for great listening . Built well to minimize accidental breakage . These are practical, not fancy ones with Bose quality . If you want higher quality, you'll have to pay for it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound tends to be muddled together, even after they break in . Move the jack while listening and the sound will crackle\/disappear for a few seconds until you get it back . Buy these if you are desperate for headphones and on a severe budget crunch .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell cleaner removes dirt and grease from the head and all the parts mounted along the entire tape path without any need to remove protective panels and doors . It is easy to clean exposed magnetic tape cassette heads, but more difficult to clean performance-degrading dirt from the tape-path capstan and rollers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Almost half of the tapes do not work properly and had to be thrown away . After 1-4 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls . After 4 uses the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell box says it can do LP and EP\/SLP modes . It won't let me choose any other length than the default SP of 2hrs . Sound and picture are good . The images aren't as good as DVD's but they really aren't that bad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" VHS Wet Cleaner does clean the heads of our VCRs very nicely . Amazon said it can't accept packages with hazardous chemicals so I can't return it . Easy to use and does the job....not much more to be said....Came when expected, does what it is suppose to do .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The waterproof clock clock clock radio works great in the shower . The buttons (any of them) won't respond anymore though (since the last fall) and the volume just stays up high now and won't go down . The receiver picks up great reception even without the antenna extension .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Etymotic ER-6 ($130) have no noise-canceling circuitry and rely purely on blocking the ear canal to reduce noise . Sennheiser HDC451s ($80), Sony MDR-NC20s ($120), and Aiwa HP-CN5 ($50) EtyMotics live up to their reputation of being one the best sounding `phones on the market at any price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" LCD display stops working, buttons become quirky, buttons act of their own free will, CDs are no longer recognized by player . Poor workmanship on inner electronics, poor quality headphones detract from bass features . Sony has made some wonderful products, but this is not one of them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder . They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back, but it was a very faint sound . These are O.K. but old technology o I may not use them much. They are hard to find locally because of the newer digital video cameras .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA RP8065 was a gift for Christmas 1998 . Within a year, it was completely shot and would not even read or play CD's, even brand new CD's . Buy two and give one as a gift like we did . Buy a Toshiba version .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The viewing angle of the LCD on the Bedroom Clock Radio Phone is very poor . The display is very bright making it hard to sleep and sometimes when I hit the snooze button, it freezes the clock until the alarm is turned off, thus making the time 9 minutes slow .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is tinny, and it emphasizes percussion over the vocals . Full blast beeping  on this unit can wake you from 20 feet away or more . I would pay more for a unit that gave real control over the volume of the alarm tone, and the way it increases .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sony D-EJ715 CD Walkman is worth every cent . The only real problem i've had was i tried to use a CD-rw in it and it screwed up the antiskip . Either way, a perfect deal for the money . The Sony . E-J 715 is worth the Sony .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the best Discman ive boughten ever . It never skips unless u throw it on the floor repeededly for about a minute . The surround sound feature sounds nothing like surround sound in part from the stock headphones . These headphones have little to no treble, so it sounds like your listening to an old 1930's AM radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The smaller size of the GE recorder is probably very beneficial to people who prefer the shoe box style but have limited space requirements . The recorder doesn't accept AC power directly directly directly . It comes with an AC adapter, the type where the transformer attaches directly to the wall and a thin wire goes from the transformer to the recorder .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only drawback is the AC cord compartment is too cramped - you have to play with the cord until you get it in just right . This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it . It's light in weight and gets great reception. It's also a perfect size to take to the park or the beach .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says it is the least expensive amplified AM radio out there . Because it does pick up weak AM stations, I'll be buying another one . Reviewer: It is not a particularly sleek or sexy-looking radio and with no digital tuning, it is old-fashioned . But its ability to get good reception at long range makes up for those deficiencies .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA has large, easy to use, readable buttons . It plays CD's and cassettes with ease, and it also is very stylish . The sound is not fantastic. It is overwhelmed by any musical flourishes you listen to . It's not as much as some Sony's and Aiwa's, though .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RS1249 had a warranty but it cost me $60 to ship it back to Texas . It would pick up radio signals even when it wasn't set to tuner . The sound is great, the controls are clear, the features are easy to use and helpful .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA RT-2300 is one of the worst Home Theater systems on the market . The sound will blow you away with it's crisp, clear, Dolby digital reciever . The only drawback is the quality of the speakers . For anyone on a budget, this system is the way to go!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA ANT200 pulls in 65-85% on the HDTV signal . If you live in a valley or have other obstructions, no antenna will work well in those cases . Stations in the local area come in very clear without a lot of adjustments to the antenna .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality is tinny and thin, and they are NOT for surround sound since you can not separate the two channels . The speakers work ok, but if anyone in your house has a cell phone or baby monitor...anything sending or receiving a signal, you will get sick of the constant static interruptions! If it wasn't for that issue, I would be happy with the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell CD\/CD-Rom Scratch Repair Kit has corrected all of the scratches on my CD's making them sound brand new . The product really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratch . The reviews are somewhat mixed but for us the stuff really has worked .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The old camcorder worked great!  I just needed some new blank tapes . The product was as described and worked well. The product is no longer available in the stores. It's not too late to find it in stores anymore. The company is selling it now but it's not always available .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These headphones are good at canceling out background noise like air conditioners, etc. However it doesn't seem to cancel out the human voice . They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Magnetic Cassette tapes are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent . Arrived on time and in perfect condition . No damage to tapes, or their plastic cases . Perfect amount of tapes to help me get rhythm down and gain a flow for my poetry .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic . These tapes work fine for recording a show you don't want to miss . These worked very well for me at both SP and SLP taping speeds . They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 8-hour tapes are equally as bad as these 6-hour ones . After 1-4 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls . There are severe dropouts and the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" First time buyer for Maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality . Not a good purchase . 1 tape out of the 3 doesn't tape, 1 the plastic case is all cracked and 1 works with no problem . No tracking problems. No trouble with them at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The fidelity with respect to the original is not as good as the other MD's that I have . The outer case does not appear to be  durable! The stickers that come  alongwith the package is pathetic . Overall the product is Ok - with the MD storage case as the saving grace .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Thomson Electronics no longer will honor lifetime warranties on items purchased prior to July 2003 . The auto wind feature was nice but not very compact .

Sound quality is very good (the best considering the price range)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AR HT181 cables will expand you're listening please due to the fact that every speaker in your system will receive it's own audio signal creating incredible audio effect . The construction of the cables are good . They are well packaged and protected with plastic caps on the tips (remove before using)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of the JM10 however, is absolutely unfit for human listening . Sound quality is better than adequate but durability isn't their long suit . The deep bass and clear music make up for that by far . For 5 dollars this is one deal you can't beat especially with the portable volume control feature .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Advent Wireless stereo headphones have good range and sound quality . The only complaint is that the ear pads have worn out and I cannot find new ones . The tuning knob on the headphone set itself is very easy to accidentally turn -- thereby  knocking it out of commision . I would recommend the Sennheiser RS40 over these headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Allsop CD laser-Lens Cleaner is more gimmick than help . It doesn't play on Linux :O(.) It's entirely possible that it's just a coincidence that my DVD player stopped working entirely after I tried to use this cleaner . After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It takes off static as well as cleaning the players, with its carbon technology . Remember to ground the lens cleaner before using, with two fingers on the shiny part . It was easy to use and I would recommend it to others as a worthwhile product . The unit stopped the frequent skipping of the CD player in my 2008 Acura RDX which had become quite annoying .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Allsop is about the best one out  there on the market currently, too, too . The fluid was less than half full as advertised . The cleaner was very dissapointed that I received a black case instead of the clear case . It removes much more than just dust and foreign particles .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" FastWipe may leave fine scratches on the surface of the disc . This will not affect the performance of the . disc . Any CD\/DVD-care product that tells you not to wipe in a circular pattern is a suspect product . If the product does not in any way mar the surface, it shouldn't matter how you wipe .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Car CD players have a front loading mechanism, as opposed to a tray or top loading, and instructions specifically say not to use it . If the brushes are out of alignment, as they should be after using the cleaner, the device will do nothing for your CD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product cleaned my tape player after it was in my closet for a year and a hafe . The only problem is with today's car manufactures car stereos that tell you when to clean head or if there is no tapeor broken tape . The stupid stereo is confused buy this item not having a tape and automatically ejects it after about 3 seconds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Allsop 60000 3-in-1 (wet) Video Cleaner came with a dry\/empty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution . Without the cleaning solution the cassette with a cleaning ribbon cannot be used .

{"text":" AW870's speakers follow me anywhere in the house so I can listen to my MP3's or the Steeler game from NFL.com every Sunday . The sound breaks up near 150-175', more so if there are a lot of walls &amp; obstructions . The speakers are heavy but small enough to be unobtrusive once placed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is by no means a high quality stereo . It doesn't have a track counter... but for this price, who cares? This is a good deal for the money . It plays scratched CD's, and you should buy it . The sound is lousy at higher volumes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Belkin Velcro Cable Ties (8 Inch) are excellent . With the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for . I have used them on all my computer cables, making my desk much neater .","product_category":"Electronics"}

Each channel will hold 2 cables such as cat , coaxial, HDMI, HDMI securely securely securely .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Can't ride a bike or even jog with this player . Can't be used anywhere but on a completely flat unmoving surface . If you want it to jogging with it, spend $10 and buy one with anti-skip . Sony gives you a lot more value for your money .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is a lot better than I expected for the money, even with the headphones that come with it . The only problem is when I move around, the headphones go in and out . The inbuilt radio has a strong reception and the sound quality of FM is adorable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is not a typical extension cord, it has one end that is made to be used with the special power connectors used on many computers, printers and TVs . The other end will plug directly into you . This would work well with a PC and desk, though I would be wary of running a high-wattage system on it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers . This is way cheaper here than in Walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra $$$ . It worked perfectly after my dog ate the first one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The color allows you to know how long you're grabbing! This was much easier than finding a longer DVI cord, or moving the surge protector . These are well built, packaged, and as described . Hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay 2-3 times the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The manufacturer of this product, Recoton, went out of business . Not mentioned in the description, or on the box, is that the 1120 is designed for 'batch' cleanings . However, for the typical home user with one or two CDs to clean at a time, look elsewhere .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SC 340 works as advertised . It did not control the on-screen menus on a RCA Satellite box . Direct TV aspect is horrible, the guide almost never works, even when the remote is 2 centimeters away from the receiver . The buttons are laid out logically and they are very easy to read .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These speakers sound like it is surround sound it looks good so when people come over you wont have to hide them . These are durable and are weather resistant and are durable . If you are a bass sound fan, you might want to buy a sub-woofer, but these do a fine job at normal range .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH 970A speakers are a great value for the price you pay for . Great sound and durability for the money . Built-in speakers are easy to install in a garage or for a patio . The 970A produces full, rich sound that belies its diminuitive size .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This does a good job cleaning the cassette players heads, playback and recording . It is the best that I have seen in awhile . I would recomend this product to anyone who wants to clean their tape player without any hassle . The company sent a bottle of liquid that only lasted a few cleanings .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is really the best MDplayer in the world! It's very small,light,simple to use and with a great sound quality . The sound quality is almost exactly like CD quality . Snag one of these while you can, I'm not sure how much longer they'll be making them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sharp MD-MS722 is a great product and would have gotten five stars if  not for a few minor details . The composite cable has scratchy sound while the digital opic cable had great sound but it couldn't connect to either of my computers or any stereos so you have to get yourself a third cable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Optical Digital Input included in this has unbelievable sound better than CD sound . The only downfall for the device is the rechargable battery pack that comes with the device . It fell on the floor so many times, and has scratches all over by now, but it plays wonderfully!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH center channel and subwoofer is a must have for anyone on a tight budget . The only complaint is that the bass sounds muffled and out of place . It would thump very loudly when powered on and the bass would flutter as if the woofer or the amp was going out .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH AV1001B Bookshelf Speakers have a good range and a very full sound at moderate volume levels . They emit a constant hum as soon as they're turned on . The sound quality is adequate (especially in an office setting where better base would bother coworkers down the hall .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SurgeArrest Pro8T2 has 8 outlets to connect devices to . It burns out pretty quickly, and the indicator that's meant to alert you of it no longer working never was lit in the first place . APC failed to honor their warranty and will not compensate him .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" APC Per7 surge arrest is really good. With 7 sockets, it almost has everything you want to put in . However, the sockets are very near each other, so if you are putting a big adapter in it, it nearly occupies 3 sockets . The only drawback is that this particular model has the on\/off switch located on the top .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Energizer batteries suffer from rapid self-discharge problem . The new 'Recharge' series has a rated capacity of 2300mAh for AA cells . After storing the batteries on the shelf for 3.5 months (108 days) the remaining charge is 88% of original capacity .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" When the batteries are exhausted (used in my Nikon Coolpix 950) the charge takes about 4 to 6 hours to bring them back to 1.35V . No you can not use this charger to charge Non Ni type Batteries. See Duracell site for more Info.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only problem that I did have with this case is that the pockets for the CD's are very tight . The only question is: Do you really need more than 12 cds handy at any given moment? You can't listen to more than one ata time and Britney Spears only has 2 albums .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a fantastic device for carrying minidiscs, but I can see a few changes that can be made . For instants, I think it should include a built-in TV, a laptop, an apartment on Park Ave, and a small dog (preferably a poodle) This is the best case that exists right now .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This product is the best way to store your CDs . Fits well in back packs . Easy to use and fast to get your CDs in and out . Space savings are incredible once you get rid of the jewel cases . With over 800 CDs these holders have been a real blessing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" If you back up files on CD-R\/RW, these are great . These binders are easy to label with today's labeller machines . The only drawback is that liner notes with more than a few pages are a very tight fit . This book eliminates that  problem;  very handy, if slightly overpriced .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This box does not convert composite\/rca to s-vhs . The only problem I've had with this switch is that it will not recognize my TiVo remote . The unit is also nicely labeled, very attractive in appearance, and has SIX inputs which is nice .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says remote does not work for RCA CD players or DVD players . Reviewer: It's not perfect, but it's the best I own for the price range . It doesn't support any LD players, but even if it did, I don't expect my old Samsung LD player to be supported .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The remote does not operate menus on my Toshiba or Pioneer DVD player . Backlit buttons make a distinct high pitched hum everytime you press a button and for the two seconds the lights remain on . Backlighting isn't as great a feature as I thought - sometimes you hit the wrong button just to get it to flash .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The reception can be a bit static-y if you are around lots of interferring equipment or concrete . The included ear pieces are a little weird, but they work fine and you can use whatever earpieces you want . For the price, you really can't beat this radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality of the AW720 is not up to the standards I would expect from Advent . The earpieces are comfortable and provide good sound quality . The feel of the headphones is like a vice and the grip on your ears is WAY too tight . The only redeeming value to the product is that the sound is relatively good .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic wallets are a great way to store DVDs and CDs . The wallets are easy to use and easy to mark the outside of the wallets with a white-out pen . The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic storage tray easily mounts on the wall of a home \/ apartment . It makes some sense to order Case Logic's slotted racks for DVDs . It's little bother to re-slot the entire collection into alphabetical, chronological, etc. order with each modification .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Gel-eez mouse pad consists of two plastic gel packs enclosed in a soft cloth . Gel pack is attached to the pad with velcro and can be  removed to be placed in the refridgerator . Gel tubes have adjustable firmness, and after suiting them to my preferences, the rest relieves all pressure from the bottom of my wrist .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave CD Player represents the future standard for portable digital audio . Sound quality is excellent and the XBS bass boost gives your music more muscle . It's still expensive, but in Canada, it's cheaper(with exchange rate of $5.5\/5)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This little CD player case is very handy . I use it to hold my CD player, accessories, batteries, and liner notes . The limiting factor with this case is that its impossible to shuffle around sheets of cds . The zipper on the case is durable and doesn't break even with great presure .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The energy level light for the batteries is a wonderful feature as well as the choice of forward or reverse play without removing the cassette and turning it over . The only complaint I have is that the headphones are not very comfortable . The earphones are large and clumsy . The two things I didn't like are the earphones which are large .","product_category":"Electronics"}
