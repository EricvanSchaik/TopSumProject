{"text":" The CLIKR-5 is an exact duplicate of my Time Warner Cable remote . It is easy to program and operates all the features on Time Warner including On Demand . If you've lost or broken yours, or if like mine some of the buttons just stopped responding, this is a great replacement .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth\/Cat engine . Exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely . Announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you) what state you are in and\/or going into .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a must for the Barnes and Noble Simple Touch Ereader . Don't buy just by the picture displayed, make sure to read the description . I am still missing the USB cable, but I'm happy to charge my nook anywhere, no need for pc.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place . It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you . The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk! A rich repertoire of beautiful Christmas music with various and numerous scenes of holiday symbols and events . Some parts are cute, some are just wierd looking .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a wonderful read and present . It changed so many lives around me including my own . This has been a great way to refresh my memory on several of the things I already know and practice . I have also gained some new information I didn't know about retirement investing and insurance .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The installation was simple but mounting the actual TV wasn't . You have to lift and hold the TV up so as to align the holes for the screws . Once up, the Tv leans to the left . The mount was installed level and the first arm is level but the second arm is not .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Nook pales in comparison to both the Kindle and the Ipad and I regret purchasing it . The convenience of the device has me back to my favorite hobby that I've been away from for years--READING! The ability to adjust the sizing of the words is what sold me .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This was my first e-reader, and remains my favorite . Battery life does last about two weeks, reading a pace of at least one to two hours per day . Battery is only consumed when the color screen is on or when pages are turned . Nook Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Amazon lists the NOOKcolor for over $300 but it's available at barnesandnoble.com for $249 + tax (~$269) The Nookcolor is heavier than the Kindle but lighter than the iPad . It is NOT a standard USB charger, so you cannot buy an off-the-shelf charger .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book . All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate . But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Nook has become probably my favorite device that I've gotten, over my ipod even, i just love it (and it's so sleek too) The e-ink screen is amazing, if you haven't tried reading on one do it . Only thing i hope they update on the software is making it possible to organize books into customized categories\/folders .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The pages turn fast and seamless, and I have never had an issue with it lagging . For people debaiting between this and a Kindle, defenitely choose Nook . They give you the ability to lend many titles, you can read any book for free .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product came in on time, included batteries, and is in perfect working condition . The screen is useless unless you really need to be reminded of what button you just pressed . The company even makes a smartphone app that does this because everyone already owns a device that is capable of what this does .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The magnetic washer that is used to manage clicks, is not attached to the box and I lost it somehow . The instructions aren't the most useful, but I used this YouTube video to help me put it together . It can get a little uncomfortable on the nose, but adding some padding (paper towel or the like) should fix that .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Google Glass is a great product but it may cause some problems in the eyes . The battery life is even shorter (30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger) I can wear it under my aero-helmet, but not without feeling pressure . The low-light capability is not great, either, and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best deal anywhere, product is exactly as described and works well! You cannot beat this price . The cable works, I don't see any problems with it, and it is a bunch cheaper than I could get from Best Buy . The audio is not interrupted, but the video goes blank every 10 seconds for 3-4 seconds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DB9 Male\/Female null model is great product for the money! It works and can fit in any computer bag without taking a space as standard cable would do! The missing pin 9 is normal for almost all null modem adapters . The quality of this null modem adaptor is invaluable. It is in itself a shrine to the quality of life .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is everything it is supposed to be and works just as well as much more expensive cables . It is easy to install and makes everything look good on tv . The cable works fine for what i needed and saved me money . Ide buy it again. It does its job .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The EZGrabber2 works well but it's software is a little lack luster . The product website doesn't even list this version of the product amongst its legacy products . It apparently needs a new driver but no one has . It doesn't have the best video capture even with the newest VHS tapes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The music and graphics stink . The only thing good about it is that it works . The graphics on the pad is better than the graphics on T.V. It looks like a Arcade game from the 70's . The positive is that you get a really good work-out. Make sure you wear a pair of socks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit isn't the most compact but is very tranformer like to accomodate multiple outlet configurations . The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This product is garbage. Had issues from the start, then at the end it came apart . Feels and looks cheap . Even though it came in a Samsung package it makes me want to think that is a cheap Chinese copy . It worked as advertised, but the cheap plastic around the USB end keeps breaking .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The shipping packaging was great and the cable came intact . The cable is a cheep cable, but you get what you pay for . The picture is not what there say for the quality of the cable . The HDMI 1.4 cable for a 3D hd, but got it, pretty quick tho, the label says version 1.3 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" HDMI cable is very good for short money, the pictures in HD through the HDMI cable are wonderful . Product has functioned properly with my Canon T2i for six months now . The cable has had no problems after six months of general use (probably has been used twenty times)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a great buy at a great price and I would highly recommend it . The HDMI cable that Canon endorsed was a bit pricey . This alternative is a good, cheaper choice . It works exactly as expected . Couldn't beat it for the price. Very satisfied with my purchase .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to . There is a delay of few seconds when I switch from the camera viewfinder to the TV but I hardly think this has to do with the cable . It looks as good as the the Canon one in terms of build quality .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The small end of the cable is not the same as pictured and does not fit the port on my tablet . The cable works great, has excellent picture quality and is very light . It may work for you but it didnt work for me. The cable does not work at all with my Asus Eee Slider or my Arcos Tablet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It is easy to connect my Camcorder to my TV and provides the desired results . It arrived in a very timely manner . Shipping was fast too . It works fine . Plugs into what I want like it should . I use this for  something, but forget where .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price was right and I get it right time !!!!! I would recommend this to all the people that I know . Good cheap long cable that actually backs up most of the capabilities . The 3-d came in a little shadowy and the Ethernet signal would not either .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product did not fit my Galaxy Tab2 - so I may have mis-understood the product listing thinking . Vendor took friendly, immediate action and solved the mistake for me . It work fine with my Coby tablet very good reception. But it was not work with my Galaxy tab 2  7.0 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The video works great but no audio. Had to add another wire for the audio. The resolution is terrible and will not always work. I want to return it for a full refund but have no means of contacting the seller through Amazon. The delivery was on time and the cable was easy to connect.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This item was exactly what I was looking for to play back my pictures on a high def TV . The cable works flawlessly . For the price it is great. I am looking forward to viewing movies in the future from my television . I have not seen the &#34;original&#36;, but I am very satisfied with this .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The company that sold this to me (A Days Tech) claimed that this was a genuine Samsung product on the Amazon listing . It simply was NOT the device that was being shown in the image, but a really crappy knock off that worked maybe half the time with my TV's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The old company either went bankrupt or sold out, but RCA has run this product into the ground . The wood handle is imprecisely cut so that the bottle no longer fits well inside . The old model had ridges of material that ran lengthwise to the handle, with the fibers angled so that they dug into the grooves and pulled out the dust, holding onto it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of the tapes was extraordinarily crisp and clear . The tapes were defective at the end of side A \/ beginning of side B, just like the Sony 120 min tapes . FRED K. WILLDERS: \"I like my music with me always, it's better than online\"","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best normal bias for Maxell is the UDXL I in the blue silver case If one can still find it . NOS is a bit overpriced and not worth the price . These are quiet tapes and don't produce any noise . If it is sold online for more than you are getting a rip off .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a very good product, these cassettes have many purposes, you can record music, record lectures, or any thing else . The batterys will do they were a little low on the power at 2.78 volts . Used to make mixtapes for her older car with a tape deck .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" XLII-90 audio cassettes are great for recording and playback of records, compact discs, and other sources where a very low-noise, high-quality cassette is needed . Unfortunately, these are no longer being manufactured . The tapes have too much drag in the mechanism .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell XLII high bias tapes are highly durable, long lasting, and play back very clear sound . A 5-pack of 90 minutes cassettes hold's a large amount of music . The construction of the casing is far stronger than most cassettes . The music from a Cassette is more alive and vibrant .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes . The audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side of the cassette deck . The better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a digital file .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Package was simple to open....no scissors or knife needed! Instructions were simple and easy to follow! Product is as described . Product works as expected . Would not be easy to use on a Philips DVD Recorder . Horrible Mistake!!! It must have screwed up the lens alignment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell cases are well made and reassemble easily . They are available here at Amazon for a very fair price . The reason I need them is because such an event is so rare is because of the rare occurrence of it happening so rare . It was below $1 per pack, not counting shipping, but $9.99 still isn't bad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The disc did not work in my car . Has not had any problems since . Does a very good job of cleaning the heads of your DVD player? How can you tell that these things are actually cleaning your DVD players?  Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is more 'mid-rangy' to me than balanced . There's some bass but not a lot, and likewise with the treble . The speakers in the HP-200 don't adjust their angle at all to accommodate the listener's ears, so you always feel as if they could just sat a wee bit better when wearing them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fits well and the inline volume control is great . The earbuds fill very well for great listening . Built well to minimize accidental breakage . These are practical, not fancy ones with Bose quality . If you want higher quality, you'll have to pay for it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound tends to be muddled together, even after they break in . Move the jack while listening and the sound will crackle\/disappear for a few seconds until you get it back . Buy these if you are desperate for headphones and on a severe budget crunch .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell cleaner removes dirt and grease from the head and all the parts mounted along the entire tape path without any need to remove protective panels and doors . It is easy to clean exposed magnetic tape cassette heads, but more difficult to clean performance-degrading dirt from the tape-path capstan and rollers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Almost half of the tapes do not work properly and had to be thrown away . After 1-4 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls . After 4 uses the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell box says it can do LP and EP\/SLP modes . It won't let me choose any other length than the default SP of 2hrs . Sound and picture are good . The images aren't as good as DVD's but they really aren't that bad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" VHS Wet Cleaner does clean the heads of our VCRs very nicely . Amazon said it can't accept packages with hazardous chemicals so I can't return it . Easy to use and does the job....not much more to be said....Came when expected, does what it is suppose to do .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The waterproof clock clock clock radio works great in the shower . The buttons (any of them) won't respond anymore though (since the last fall) and the volume just stays up high now and won't go down . The receiver picks up great reception even without the antenna extension .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Etymotic ER-6 ($130) have no noise-canceling circuitry and rely purely on blocking the ear canal to reduce noise . Sennheiser HDC451s ($80), Sony MDR-NC20s ($120), and Aiwa HP-CN5 ($50) EtyMotics live up to their reputation of being one the best sounding `phones on the market at any price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" LCD display stops working, buttons become quirky, buttons act of their own free will, CDs are no longer recognized by player . Poor workmanship on inner electronics, poor quality headphones detract from bass features . Sony has made some wonderful products, but this is not one of them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder . They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back, but it was a very faint sound . These are O.K. but old technology o I may not use them much. They are hard to find locally because of the newer digital video cameras .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA RP8065 was a gift for Christmas 1998 . Within a year, it was completely shot and would not even read or play CD's, even brand new CD's . Buy two and give one as a gift like we did . Buy a Toshiba version .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The viewing angle of the LCD on the Bedroom Clock Radio Phone is very poor . The display is very bright making it hard to sleep and sometimes when I hit the snooze button, it freezes the clock until the alarm is turned off, thus making the time 9 minutes slow .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is tinny, and it emphasizes percussion over the vocals . Full blast beeping  on this unit can wake you from 20 feet away or more . I would pay more for a unit that gave real control over the volume of the alarm tone, and the way it increases .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sony D-EJ715 CD Walkman is worth every cent . The only real problem i've had was i tried to use a CD-rw in it and it screwed up the antiskip . Either way, a perfect deal for the money . The Sony . E-J 715 is worth the Sony .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the best Discman ive boughten ever . It never skips unless u throw it on the floor repeededly for about a minute . The surround sound feature sounds nothing like surround sound in part from the stock headphones . These headphones have little to no treble, so it sounds like your listening to an old 1930's AM radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The smaller size of the GE recorder is probably very beneficial to people who prefer the shoe box style but have limited space requirements . The recorder doesn't accept AC power directly directly directly . It comes with an AC adapter, the type where the transformer attaches directly to the wall and a thin wire goes from the transformer to the recorder .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only drawback is the AC cord compartment is too cramped - you have to play with the cord until you get it in just right . This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it . It's light in weight and gets great reception. It's also a perfect size to take to the park or the beach .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says it is the least expensive amplified AM radio out there . Because it does pick up weak AM stations, I'll be buying another one . Reviewer: It is not a particularly sleek or sexy-looking radio and with no digital tuning, it is old-fashioned . But its ability to get good reception at long range makes up for those deficiencies .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA has large, easy to use, readable buttons . It plays CD's and cassettes with ease, and it also is very stylish . The sound is not fantastic. It is overwhelmed by any musical flourishes you listen to . It's not as much as some Sony's and Aiwa's, though .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RS1249 had a warranty but it cost me $60 to ship it back to Texas . It would pick up radio signals even when it wasn't set to tuner . The sound is great, the controls are clear, the features are easy to use and helpful .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA RT-2300 is one of the worst Home Theater systems on the market . The sound will blow you away with it's crisp, clear, Dolby digital reciever . The only drawback is the quality of the speakers . For anyone on a budget, this system is the way to go!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA ANT200 pulls in 65-85% on the HDTV signal . If you live in a valley or have other obstructions, no antenna will work well in those cases . Stations in the local area come in very clear without a lot of adjustments to the antenna .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality is tinny and thin, and they are NOT for surround sound since you can not separate the two channels . The speakers work ok, but if anyone in your house has a cell phone or baby monitor...anything sending or receiving a signal, you will get sick of the constant static interruptions! If it wasn't for that issue, I would be happy with the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell CD\/CD-Rom Scratch Repair Kit has corrected all of the scratches on my CD's making them sound brand new . The product really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratch . The reviews are somewhat mixed but for us the stuff really has worked .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The old camcorder worked great!  I just needed some new blank tapes . The product was as described and worked well. The product is no longer available in the stores. It's not too late to find it in stores anymore. The company is selling it now but it's not always available .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These headphones are good at canceling out background noise like air conditioners, etc. However it doesn't seem to cancel out the human voice . They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Magnetic Cassette tapes are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent . Arrived on time and in perfect condition . No damage to tapes, or their plastic cases . Perfect amount of tapes to help me get rhythm down and gain a flow for my poetry .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic . These tapes work fine for recording a show you don't want to miss . These worked very well for me at both SP and SLP taping speeds . They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 8-hour tapes are equally as bad as these 6-hour ones . After 1-4 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls . There are severe dropouts and the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" First time buyer for Maxell very happy with the product excellent price and quality . Not a good purchase . 1 tape out of the 3 doesn't tape, 1 the plastic case is all cracked and 1 works with no problem . No tracking problems. No trouble with them at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The fidelity with respect to the original is not as good as the other MD's that I have . The outer case does not appear to be  durable! The stickers that come  alongwith the package is pathetic . Overall the product is Ok - with the MD storage case as the saving grace .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Thomson Electronics no longer will honor lifetime warranties on items purchased prior to July 2003 . The auto wind feature was nice but not very compact .

Sound quality is very good (the best considering the price range)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AR HT181 cables will expand you're listening please due to the fact that every speaker in your system will receive it's own audio signal creating incredible audio effect . The construction of the cables are good . They are well packaged and protected with plastic caps on the tips (remove before using)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of the JM10 however, is absolutely unfit for human listening . Sound quality is better than adequate but durability isn't their long suit . The deep bass and clear music make up for that by far . For 5 dollars this is one deal you can't beat especially with the portable volume control feature .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Advent Wireless stereo headphones have good range and sound quality . The only complaint is that the ear pads have worn out and I cannot find new ones . The tuning knob on the headphone set itself is very easy to accidentally turn -- thereby  knocking it out of commision . I would recommend the Sennheiser RS40 over these headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Allsop CD laser-Lens Cleaner is more gimmick than help . It doesn't play on Linux :O(.) It's entirely possible that it's just a coincidence that my DVD player stopped working entirely after I tried to use this cleaner . After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It takes off static as well as cleaning the players, with its carbon technology . Remember to ground the lens cleaner before using, with two fingers on the shiny part . It was easy to use and I would recommend it to others as a worthwhile product . The unit stopped the frequent skipping of the CD player in my 2008 Acura RDX which had become quite annoying .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Allsop is about the best one out  there on the market currently, too, too . The fluid was less than half full as advertised . The cleaner was very dissapointed that I received a black case instead of the clear case . It removes much more than just dust and foreign particles .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" FastWipe may leave fine scratches on the surface of the disc . This will not affect the performance of the . disc . Any CD\/DVD-care product that tells you not to wipe in a circular pattern is a suspect product . If the product does not in any way mar the surface, it shouldn't matter how you wipe .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Car CD players have a front loading mechanism, as opposed to a tray or top loading, and instructions specifically say not to use it . If the brushes are out of alignment, as they should be after using the cleaner, the device will do nothing for your CD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product cleaned my tape player after it was in my closet for a year and a hafe . The only problem is with today's car manufactures car stereos that tell you when to clean head or if there is no tapeor broken tape . The stupid stereo is confused buy this item not having a tape and automatically ejects it after about 3 seconds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Allsop 60000 3-in-1 (wet) Video Cleaner came with a dry\/empty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution . Without the cleaning solution the cassette with a cleaning ribbon cannot be used .

{"text":" AW870's speakers follow me anywhere in the house so I can listen to my MP3's or the Steeler game from NFL.com every Sunday . The sound breaks up near 150-175', more so if there are a lot of walls &amp; obstructions . The speakers are heavy but small enough to be unobtrusive once placed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is by no means a high quality stereo . It doesn't have a track counter... but for this price, who cares? This is a good deal for the money . It plays scratched CD's, and you should buy it . The sound is lousy at higher volumes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Belkin Velcro Cable Ties (8 Inch) are excellent . With the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for . I have used them on all my computer cables, making my desk much neater .","product_category":"Electronics"}

Each channel will hold 2 cables such as cat , coaxial, HDMI, HDMI securely securely securely .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Can't ride a bike or even jog with this player . Can't be used anywhere but on a completely flat unmoving surface . If you want it to jogging with it, spend $10 and buy one with anti-skip . Sony gives you a lot more value for your money .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is a lot better than I expected for the money, even with the headphones that come with it . The only problem is when I move around, the headphones go in and out . The inbuilt radio has a strong reception and the sound quality of FM is adorable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is not a typical extension cord, it has one end that is made to be used with the special power connectors used on many computers, printers and TVs . The other end will plug directly into you . This would work well with a PC and desk, though I would be wary of running a high-wattage system on it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a basic pc cable it works on most computers and monitors and some printers . This is way cheaper here than in Walmart or another store so if you can wait for it in the mail do it will save you some extra $$$ . It worked perfectly after my dog ate the first one .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The color allows you to know how long you're grabbing! This was much easier than finding a longer DVI cord, or moving the surge protector . These are well built, packaged, and as described . Hard to find in stores and if you do find it expect to pay 2-3 times the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The manufacturer of this product, Recoton, went out of business . Not mentioned in the description, or on the box, is that the 1120 is designed for 'batch' cleanings . However, for the typical home user with one or two CDs to clean at a time, look elsewhere .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SC 340 works as advertised . It did not control the on-screen menus on a RCA Satellite box . Direct TV aspect is horrible, the guide almost never works, even when the remote is 2 centimeters away from the receiver . The buttons are laid out logically and they are very easy to read .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These speakers sound like it is surround sound it looks good so when people come over you wont have to hide them . These are durable and are weather resistant and are durable . If you are a bass sound fan, you might want to buy a sub-woofer, but these do a fine job at normal range .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH 970A speakers are a great value for the price you pay for . Great sound and durability for the money . Built-in speakers are easy to install in a garage or for a patio . The 970A produces full, rich sound that belies its diminuitive size .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This does a good job cleaning the cassette players heads, playback and recording . It is the best that I have seen in awhile . I would recomend this product to anyone who wants to clean their tape player without any hassle . The company sent a bottle of liquid that only lasted a few cleanings .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is really the best MDplayer in the world! It's very small,light,simple to use and with a great sound quality . The sound quality is almost exactly like CD quality . Snag one of these while you can, I'm not sure how much longer they'll be making them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sharp MD-MS722 is a great product and would have gotten five stars if  not for a few minor details . The composite cable has scratchy sound while the digital opic cable had great sound but it couldn't connect to either of my computers or any stereos so you have to get yourself a third cable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Optical Digital Input included in this has unbelievable sound better than CD sound . The only downfall for the device is the rechargable battery pack that comes with the device . It fell on the floor so many times, and has scratches all over by now, but it plays wonderfully!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH center channel and subwoofer is a must have for anyone on a tight budget . The only complaint is that the bass sounds muffled and out of place . It would thump very loudly when powered on and the bass would flutter as if the woofer or the amp was going out .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH AV1001B Bookshelf Speakers have a good range and a very full sound at moderate volume levels . They emit a constant hum as soon as they're turned on . The sound quality is adequate (especially in an office setting where better base would bother coworkers down the hall .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SurgeArrest Pro8T2 has 8 outlets to connect devices to . It burns out pretty quickly, and the indicator that's meant to alert you of it no longer working never was lit in the first place . APC failed to honor their warranty and will not compensate him .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" APC Per7 surge arrest is really good. With 7 sockets, it almost has everything you want to put in . However, the sockets are very near each other, so if you are putting a big adapter in it, it nearly occupies 3 sockets . The only drawback is that this particular model has the on\/off switch located on the top .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Energizer batteries suffer from rapid self-discharge problem . The new 'Recharge' series has a rated capacity of 2300mAh for AA cells . After storing the batteries on the shelf for 3.5 months (108 days) the remaining charge is 88% of original capacity .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" When the batteries are exhausted (used in my Nikon Coolpix 950) the charge takes about 4 to 6 hours to bring them back to 1.35V . No you can not use this charger to charge Non Ni type Batteries. See Duracell site for more Info.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only problem that I did have with this case is that the pockets for the CD's are very tight . The only question is: Do you really need more than 12 cds handy at any given moment? You can't listen to more than one ata time and Britney Spears only has 2 albums .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a fantastic device for carrying minidiscs, but I can see a few changes that can be made . For instants, I think it should include a built-in TV, a laptop, an apartment on Park Ave, and a small dog (preferably a poodle) This is the best case that exists right now .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This product is the best way to store your CDs . Fits well in back packs . Easy to use and fast to get your CDs in and out . Space savings are incredible once you get rid of the jewel cases . With over 800 CDs these holders have been a real blessing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" If you back up files on CD-R\/RW, these are great . These binders are easy to label with today's labeller machines . The only drawback is that liner notes with more than a few pages are a very tight fit . This book eliminates that  problem;  very handy, if slightly overpriced .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This box does not convert composite\/rca to s-vhs . The only problem I've had with this switch is that it will not recognize my TiVo remote . The unit is also nicely labeled, very attractive in appearance, and has SIX inputs which is nice .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says remote does not work for RCA CD players or DVD players . Reviewer: It's not perfect, but it's the best I own for the price range . It doesn't support any LD players, but even if it did, I don't expect my old Samsung LD player to be supported .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The remote does not operate menus on my Toshiba or Pioneer DVD player . Backlit buttons make a distinct high pitched hum everytime you press a button and for the two seconds the lights remain on . Backlighting isn't as great a feature as I thought - sometimes you hit the wrong button just to get it to flash .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The reception can be a bit static-y if you are around lots of interferring equipment or concrete . The included ear pieces are a little weird, but they work fine and you can use whatever earpieces you want . For the price, you really can't beat this radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality of the AW720 is not up to the standards I would expect from Advent . The earpieces are comfortable and provide good sound quality . The feel of the headphones is like a vice and the grip on your ears is WAY too tight . The only redeeming value to the product is that the sound is relatively good .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic wallets are a great way to store DVDs and CDs . The wallets are easy to use and easy to mark the outside of the wallets with a white-out pen . The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic storage tray easily mounts on the wall of a home \/ apartment . It makes some sense to order Case Logic's slotted racks for DVDs . It's little bother to re-slot the entire collection into alphabetical, chronological, etc. order with each modification .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Gel-eez mouse pad consists of two plastic gel packs enclosed in a soft cloth . Gel pack is attached to the pad with velcro and can be  removed to be placed in the refridgerator .

{"text":" This little CD player case is very handy . I use it to hold my CD player, accessories, batteries, and liner notes . The limiting factor with this case is that its impossible to shuffle around sheets of cds . The zipper on the case is durable and doesn't break even with great presure .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The energy level light for the batteries is a wonderful feature as well as the choice of forward or reverse play without removing the cassette and turning it over . The only complaint I have is that the headphones are not very comfortable . The earphones are large and clumsy . The two things I didn't like are the earphones which are large .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This system is too loud for my apartment at volume 3 and it goes over 20, but I don't won't become deaf!

The average selling 20 dollar boombox could out performe this hunk of junk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JVC discontinued the RV-B model KaBoom . Heavy, heavy, ate batteries like it was going out of style, but so what? I'd put up with all those short commings because of the sound . I love this Stereo for cammping and on the boat and at the cabin .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fisher SLIM-1500 can't play CD's in it without having them skip repeatedly . The sound on my laptop computer is far superior to this sound system .

{"text":" GPX is the only electronics company I know without a Web page or 800 number for service issues . The price for the quality and variety of this system (somewhat) makes up for these inconveniences . The turntable is more than servicable, the radio is limited in range .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The only minor flaw was a tiny crack in the plastic container . 30 out of 40 disks failed  all garbage all garbage . It's very time consuming when these disks fail .

{"text":" The top of the disc has space for you to write the title and contents of the CD, but it doesn't look very good . Only buy these CD-Rs if you are using a computer-component type of CD-R burners . The only downside to these CDs is the top of these CDs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Good for recording VCR quality video . Good for Hi8 or Digital 8 camcorders . Meets the needs of family recording device . Good price, good price, timely delivery .

{"text":" SkipDoctor only worked on 1 CD not 50 . It did acually work but the wheel that fixes the CD started to come apart after only 1 CD . This device destroys more CDs than it fixes .

{"text":" The shaft of the microphone broke as I took it out of the box . At its price, this mic can't be beat!

{"text":" The tape broke while recording a TV show. for the very first time. No wonder it has been discontinued, it doesn't work at all. The Mexican plant must have unhappy workers.

{"text":" Product by APC has reliable reputation, have had no problems with product .

The green indicator light lets you know the APC is up and running .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This product is a MUST have for the mobile notebook user . It is easy to insert into your notebook power adapter and it protects the phone modem also . The only downside is that Dell changed the shape and design of the power brick on their new laptops, so this surge protector does not strap on to the power bricks as nicely as the old .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex CD-R's are the only brand I have used that played in all my players . The sound is crisp and indestinguishable from the original on my home stereo, computer, or car stereo . Amazon.com has clearly the best price I have seen .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" A single AA battery will keep it playing for at least 8 hours, and it weighs almost nothing . Compressing the music will only make your music sound pretty bad . The only problem is the slow process of recording your CDs and putting it into the device . A new Rio is coming out with 64MB of flash memory included .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The controls are flimsy, but if you put them on backwards they fit and work fine . The only problem is the buttons are a little too small . In the car whenever there is the slightest bump, the CD player gets cranky and turns itself off for no reason .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The BC 895XLT is easy to learn how to use . Good sensitivity, and it doesn't overload from strong signals .

Also scans conventional radio systems, but you can't monitor trunked and conventional systems at the same time .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product is moderately comfortable and the quality is about what you would expect from its price .

{"text":" JVC's FS7000 system is a must for those who want to get a great office\/apt music system . It's tiny size and looks are great . It beats the ridiculously priced BOSE system hand down . It has one of the best sounds I have heard on a system this size .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" $7.99 headphones are one of the worst purchases I've made in the last year . The sound quality fades and gets staticky when my laptop moves . Cushioned earpieces provide a good degree of comfort while dampening noise from the headphones so that others are not annoyed by your music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These headphones deliver good treble effects as well as decent bass . They deliver rich base, yet the treble is pure, too . Can't beat the sound for the price . Use mine for jogging.

{"text":" Someone borrowed my sony mini tape recorder to get some detailed infomation and asked if they could keep the tape . I assured them that was fine I would just buy some .

So I checked online and there they were...so thanks for the variey of products supplied by the sellers on Amazon.com!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Grundig G2000A is a cheap Chinese radio of questionable quality control . It has few features and mediocre sound on AM and more so on FM . DXers should pass it by! It was a gift for my husband, he was thrilled , he had one years ago and the on and off button stopped working .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Grundig YB400-PE is a solid investment for anyone starting out on world band radio . The Kaito 1102 is similarly sized and fifty dollars cheaper than the YB 400\/SW\/FM . The backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of LED's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Grundig Classic is designed to call to mind the wonderful days of sitting around the radio listening to Fibber McGee and Molly . Most of the materials used in this presentation weren't even invented then . With the exception of AM broadcasts, it doesn't perform as well as a portable battery powered Sony .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This sub is GI-NORMOUS! Not, big... not large, not even huge... I repeat, THIS SUB is . This sub has it's act together:  You have both line-level and speaker-level inputs . Also, this sub supports dual channel input for more accurate bass response .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is an excellent CD Player . It provides storage for 200 CDs and keeps them organized . You can label each CD with a title of up to 13 characters . Delete File feature lets you permanently skip over unwanted tracks on any or all of your CDs . The only drawback to this changer is that it is not keyboard compatible .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Emersons are full of static and intermittant even when close to the transmitter, rendering them worthless . They require 16 batteries, which is not disclosed . The speakers are a bit ornery, and it takes some work to align things right . One of the speakers works great but the other has some problems picking up the signal .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers are the smallest satellite speakers the smallest I've seen, comparable to Bose, without the Bose price . Subwoofer offers plenty of punch, but the center speaker is devoid of ability to reproduce understandable dialogue . For music, this system is totally lacking in any mid range . The only really bad thing I can say is that I have had trouble with speaker wires .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The adapter is a great idea for playing VHS-C tapes in your regular VCR but mine stuck in the VCR every time I used it . The single battery (AA i think) lasted easily for 30+ hours or so of playback time and is ready for more .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Emerson EHP1000RF is the best of its kind that I have experienced and I tried many. None has given me the clarity of sound amplification which Emerson 1000 Headphone system has provided. The headphones themselves are the small cushioned type that just clumsily sit on your year. Not painful but you couldn't call them comfortable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The PC software used for programming the remote is very easy to use and a nice surprise coming from the kings of bad user interface design--Microsoft . The most serious shortcoming of the Sony remote is that the display is hardly viewable without activating the backlight . Some commands a device uses are difficult to program into the unit in a way that is simple to use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Koss products do not last. They are not durable, and will skip if you sneeze hard . Stick with the trusted and true brands. Remember: There is a reason why  Koss is so cheap! Good job, Koss . It's one of the best in that price range .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ESP is great and having traveled on planes, trains, and automobiles with it active there has never been a time where it continually skipped . The only thing that's ever happened to it is that there are minor scratch marks on the silver plated top which show in the light .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Pioneer CT-W606DR is sound, built well (never had a problem or issue) and even more important is available . New ones can be had for as little as $215+ shipping . Only deck I like better is the Pioneer's Elite CT-07D which has all the family looks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The PD-F507 is a good player for a second system or your garage stereo . It plays the entire CD, but when I try to switch to any other CD, it makes a loud noise, and doesn't do anything . The player is absolutely terrible. It plays .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" One of the tapes had a broken case, but one was damaged, probably before it was even mailed . Get Maxell tapes instead of Sony brand VHS tapes . The quality of these tapes has been to many flaws with the tape . Some sellers are asking too much money for what still does an old product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JVC XL-MC222BK is a good player, but it does have set limits hard core music fans will not deal with . Difficult to fit player  in entertainment unit due to height and depth . Occasionally rejects  lending-library CDs which have security strips glued to label surface . Rotating these discs 180 degrees when loading sometimes permits play .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic CD-ROM Storage Sleeves are a great way to save space in your CD storage area . Discard jewel boxes - the ones that aren't already broken - and keep your CDs in the sleeves, stored card index style . The loose format allows you to pick and choose the arrangement of your discs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This system is a definite buy for enthusiasts who want excellent sound reproduction for under 500 bucks . It's only drawback is the housing of the subwoofers affects the bass bass waves-- when you sit away 5 feet+ and leave the room, the bass seems to have disappeared . The unit lends itself to synthesizer-based music but forget about listening happily to classical music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The advertising said that this microphone was, &quot;ideal for voice recording, voice recognition software or telephony over the internet . It picks up the sound of me quietly humming all the way across the room . It is great for chat programs that allow talking with mics and also good for talking with PC cameras .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ESP function is the  worst available, and you can get much better makes for the same price(or less) This is by far the best portable CD player there is! The only thing ESP would be needed for is to keep it from skipping while you are trying to damage and break it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality and resolution during play back is great . These are good basic tapes for use in my eight year old Sony Digital8 camera . Why get a new camera when I can get really good video with all the features I need to transfer them onto DVD using this older camera?","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Rio is a great way to listen to own digital-quality, custom-compilations while on the move . The sound is terrific . The only drawback is that this is model (with the  biggest memory) only holds about 16 songs, and you have to go back to your PC to load new ones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The amplifier S53AMI blew and from what I have been able to learn on the web this is not an uncommon problem . Sub will start making a machine gun sound without even having audio signal driving it . The circuitry is terrible. Sub will shake my entire house and knock off the picture frames off the wall if not fixed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction . It can be a little persnickety about placement within a room, especially at the limits of its range . Since it's wireless, it is subject to RF interference . If you put it near other electronic equipment, it can pick up noise .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The lid of the machine seems to get stuck after it is  done rewinding (or fast forwarding) tapes . Most of the time, it fails to completely rewind the tape, leaving at least 1-1\/2 hours of tape at the beginning . The design and build quality is quite flimsy and poor .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Ambico tape rewinder was a gift to my mom since hers was dying after 15 + years of use . The cover would not close and the tape rewinded the wrong way . The company's customer service was horrible . Do not buy Ambico...they do not honor warranty .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Grundig 100 Mini PE Portable Radio is the smallest world band receiver I've come across . It features six shortwave bands (49, 41, 31, 25, 19, 15 meter bands) plus AM and FM Stereo . Reception is reasonable for a receiver of this size, with many strong signals being heard at night .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Grundig YB300PE is a great value in a PLL-digitally-tuned radio . It is being phased out in favor of the Eton\/Grundig E100 . The direct frequency input is unheard of at this price . The radio is no longer made in Taiwan but mainland China .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" They are wonderful and fit my small camcorder . They were reasonably priced and arrived in record time . They work well for us. We use them for short engineering videos and the occasional product promos footage . They are now no longer sold in stores. They are no longer available in stores .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Rio 500 is the only mp3 player that can support over 64MB of memory . With its tiny size, sleek design, and good quality, it's well worth the $200 pricetag . Sound output is just as good as a CD player . With a download rate of 0.5MB per second, it takes just 4 minutes to fill 128MB .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Audio Manager is a pain to use as quite a few steps are required to transfer each piece of music . One hour and forty minutes is the most I've been able to load before I reach the saturation point of 64megs . The only complaint I have is the price of the memory cards used to upgrade the memory .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RIO PMP300 is lightweight, small, decent on battery power, no moving parts . Holds  about 44 minutes at 192kbps (almost CD Quality) $100 for an extra 32mb card (22 minutes of almost CD-Quality) Bad memory clusters cause skips over time .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa comes with an unbendable, three month, sad warrenty . The tape player never did work properly and by the  second month, the CDs began skipping . My advice?   Save your money for a Sony . The only problem we've ever had was a common CD skipping issue in 2004 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SC-AK17 had the best sound quality out of all of them . With 100 watts and two Sub-Woofers this thing ROCKS! You can change the sound quality of the system to soft, heavy, live, concert, hall, hall or combined .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a sophisticated, well-made device with a folding headset, remote, rechargeable batteries, power adapter, optical cable and an optical cable . The buttons, especially the fast forward and reverse, are tough to handle and even worse the editing buttons are on the underside of the unit .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" XL-MC334BK CD Changer is a nice product at a really good price . Only drawbacks are the inability to play random within groups of CD's and the lack of an RS232 interface to load all of the CD  title,author,track etc info . The sound quality is decent for a mega changer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SL-MC7 plays the wrong disk on occasion, that occasion being when the disk is in the wrong slot . It skips on a dirty or scratched disk like any other player . Cleaning or polishing the offending disk usually fixes the problem . It also plays cdr's burnt on a Liteon 52246S with Nero .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The most common reason for these changers to fail is a very small drive belt on the mechanism that scans the discs . The remote control is universal for all the SL-MCxx series . It takes a while to set up the groups but, once done, it is a handy feature . Buy only if you treat your AV equipment like it's made of thin glass .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Received from a thrift store for $12 and the remote later on for $10 . Received from anonymous 'reviewer' named 'an electronics fan' in the space of 10 days, from six years ago . Reviewer: \"After a month of playing with it, I understand why he gave it away.  It sucks\"","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SL-PD8 comes with a remote, but layout of the control panel leaves much to be desired . The disk skip button is awkward to reach when the platter is open and that you must use the button which is as hard to reach as the button with the door open . The unit is slightly bulky but very sturdy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This disk can hold many many mp3 songs and play so clear . It's great for downloading music on web (Mp3 etc.) or just recording music that you already have . The price is unbeatable. It's a great buy!!...and you can't beat the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This model is the best weather machine, with the loudest siren, I've ever had . Reception quality was good on active weather channels in this area . The 74105XL does not feature the SAME specific area warning system . It's probably best suited to milder climes or environments where a highly localized warning may not be as essential .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The time is very hard to read, and even if I leave my contact lenses in, I still can't read it when the room is dark . It is easy to program in order to localize the weather warnings, but curiously, it is laborious to set the clock and alarm . Alerts are at least 2-4 minutes ahead of any television or radio announcements .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Pioneer PD-F908 101 CD Changer is easy to set up, easy to use, and fast, changes disc's in 10 seconds . It holds 101 CD's giving me access to 96 more at my fingertips . The player has played every CD I have put into it without fail . It is shorter than larger capacity jukeboxes, making it easier to store in smaller entertainment centers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The alarm was horrible all it gave was a beeping sound that gradually got louder . It's not a fancy clock, with a ton of glorified features such as CD player, nature sounds, etc.; just a plan alarm clock that does the job its suppose to, and does it well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Light on the face (time\/frequency) is too bright (for me) for sleeping with it beside your head . The best thing about this clock radio is the alarm that can be set for specific days of the week . Drawback:  Its total functioning is a little complicated; so hold on to your manual .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The small size and clip fastener makes it the best of the lot; small snags:  the headphones may be too bulky compared with smaller versions available . The reception on the SRFM32 is decent, not superlative, but that is the reason I only give it 4 stars .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Tuning is very good but sound is not the best (a personal opinion, certainly) Great tuner, reception, quality sound, extremely durable and crash proof . It's a little oversized and a little over-sized . $300 for $20 radio?  I don't think so .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It is heavy and the aluminum piece flops out uncontrolably (it doesn't stay latched down) This is not like some of the models you may have seen in the stores . The bass-modes button is the largest . The mega-bass (MB) mode is much appreciated .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Great sound, rugged, convenient controls, auto-reverse, belt clip that's long enough not to squeeze off belt when I bend over . Included headphones have a cord that's too short for good FM reception, but with set of phones with a cord of more normal length, reception is fine .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Monostrap is very comfortable in the way it's weight is distributed, and there's only one strap (of course) The only thing I would change about it is the size of the cell phone pocket . Recommended for people with small instruments but large amounts of accessories .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The padded section (for a laptop computer) is only padded on 3 sides, leaving one entire side of the computer unprotected .

{"text":" This is a super-working gal-uzuz you never know what you might need . Has lots of zip pockets for valuables, a special place for keys, and a padded pocket for e-mail . Has room for everything and then some looking to carry it without looking without looking .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Back Office is a great value for the price . The laptop compartment is not big enough for my computer and doesn't offer a lot of protection . It's got lots of room for stuff and it's great for  overnights and longer trips . The bag is wide, most of the weight is distributed across the width of my back .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Each tower comes with two connectors that join two towers together at the  top and bottom, creating a third 25-disc storage area between them .

{"text":" For the cost, you get an amazing unit . The bottons on this device are too close together which gets annoying if you're trying to work with it without looking at it while jogging for instance . At work I can record at CD Quality at FOUR TIMES playback speed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Neon bright floppies come in a clear plastic\/acrylic case (great for keeping organized) along with sticker labels . They work just fine--is that high enough praise for a computer disk? Oh, and the colors are pretty . The only problem that I had was with the broken case .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It took too long to get it. It was a nice find before I am forced to upgrade my old camcorder . Delivery was swift & complete! Delivery of the product was swift and complete! It was delivered on time . It was always a good product in the cassette days, and still good for video .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is just fine for my undiscriminating listening . The volume slide-control tends to get rusty and sticks, so forget that feature . The mid range is way too high while the bass and treble (especially the bass) are cut out . For the price, these headphones are an ok buy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Hard to find a CD \/ cassette deck combination in this day . Seems to be the best price for the unit . Good for both CD and Cassette tapes with easy functions for those needing user friendly features . Sound is very good for cassettes. Good for old schoolers with a large collection of music in these media .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only thing I can say that is not good is that it does not have a place to plug in a microphone as most cassette player\/recorders have . It only has Dolby B noise reduction, but that is fine considering that there were no commercial tapes made in Dolby C or DBX .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a nice sounding deck, but the tape transport is cheap and unreliable . This player allows tape-to-tape duplication as well as the ability to put two of your old collection in and listen uninterrupted . It's just a great deal, especially for the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JVC CD player combines excellent sound quality with ease of use . It is just shy of 15\" deep which is perfect if you are dealing with limited space .

White noise is the only problem I have with these headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The company I ordered this fromMegaRetailStore replied back to my complaint almost instantly and resolved the issue by giving me a return for free . The cleaner pictured here on this page is different from the original model I received . With the newer model, the tape would not even play . The VCR shut off almost immediately after pressing play .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers were easy to mount with the included free mounting brackets . Sound is decent but not like you'd expect from more expensive bookshelf speakers in your den or living room . Good sound for a 6.1 setup, mounting is very easy . For a cheap pair of outdoor speakers these sound better than the price warrants .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AudioSource LS100 speakers sound better than their price would lead you to suspect . Stereo separation is excellent and the speakers have a nice blended tone without sounding muddled . These speakers sound great. They don't have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sub cabinet is actually particle board, NOT medium density fibreboard (MDF), as described...it would be notably heavier, and way less resonant if it were . Don't drive it wide open, and it should perform just fine . The sound difference is incredible, with the lows now thundering .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sub is a great bargain---for home theatre . It will not go super loud or super deep without some distortion, but it's not bad . The lows are truely in the SUB-woofer range, as opposed to most &quot;subs&quot.; which are actually in the woofer range .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Best system I have found for storing a large amount of CDs in small space . Includes room for a CD and room for  a 'CD slick' pamplet to be added . Double-sided sleeves hold two discs per sleeve . Transporting CD's around is simple and convenient .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Roladisc Library is the easiest way to hold your CD collection . Case is somewhat flimsy as is but a few drops of white glue fixes that in a hurry . It's easy to drill holes and put wood screws in the corners or screw on a plywood base to hold it together .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This little case has taken several dents, been stomped by toddlers and rambunctious kids, and gotten knocked around with luggage in the back of the van . It still works just fine and the disks inside are pristine . The only drawback is the way the CDs are stored--it's a decent system, but I've seen better .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The construction seems to be of high quality, and it holds on to the disks well . It's impossible to tell one CD from another without taking them out . If there were some kind of labeling system, that would help . The velcro holds the holder in place nice and tight . The holder is light and great for trips or long airplane rides .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product has a straight plug, not the right-angle plug as pictured--if that is what you want (like me) then look elsewhere . It was common for me to hear a voice on the left channel that the listener of the right channel couldn't hear, and vice versa .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The balance is great, not bass heavy at all - don't listen to that other guy . The bonus earbuds are a joke - worse I've EVER heard, but the Head phones rock :) Worth the money if you aren't an extreme audiophile . The padding around the ears is excellant .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Headband is made of metal not plastic, so you can stretch them out to fit your head without worrying about breaking them . Volume control sounds interesting (and even useful) but is not well implemented . Audio quality does not meet expectations . Sound quality is good, but the base is great,  but not worth giving up comfort .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These headphones stick in your ears like an earplug, staying put until you explicitly try to remove them . Sound is good from these cans, though not excellent . They do a fair job isolating outside noise, though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces . The only thing they have going for them is that they are cute .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The volume controller is reasonably well designed; no crackling drop out of volume, or other distortion during use . It's ergonomics allow it to feel good in either hand . The connecting cord is to short and the quality of the wire feels cheap . It would have been nice if the cord was removable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are warm sounding, poorly detailed headphones . At lower volumes, the KTX 4 is O.k. for the $10 you spend . Consider paying a couple  of bucks more for KTX 6, KTX Pro, or the SportaPro if you want some inexpensive headphones to replace the ones that come with portable CD players .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs . They fit rather tightly around my head even though I have them adjusted properly . The bass response of these phones is quite good,  and I have found that only a slight bass boost or maybe none at all yields balanced sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them . Simple design, great sound . No trouble listening for a few hours.. An entire movie?? might be bit difficult, but with just one or two breaks, u will enjoy the experience .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Koss TD61's earpieces fit comfortably over both ears, while these earpieces are noticeably smaller . The sound isolation is great, they are huge so they will fit anyone's head . The only downside is the flimsy plastic construction - if you're going to use these outside make sure they are securely attached .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The bass is the best I have ever heard from headphones, and the mid and high notes are also clear and well defined . The headphones have gold plated connection plug, as well as an adapter to plug them into your older stereo . Crackling sound is very noticeable on one side of the headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The EQ100 has an equalizer in\/out button that you can press to immediately hear the difference it makes . For $60 I'm happy. This one is a terrific deal for the money,for like most electronics , it would have been much more money years ago .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality of my albums has gone from a 2 to a 10 . The unit does not add any distortion at all . The audio input and output to analog only . Therefore if you have digital audio, you need to get a converter . It is really alot of fun to watch your music and\/or movies come to life .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Both camera body and lens appear to have been made in Japan . Exposure meter is quite difficult to figure as there's no indicator (light or arrow) to set proper exposure . There are no shortcuts in photography unless you only care about snapshots . The lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The memory is only 32 MBs, so you'll probably have to buy a FlashMemory card to store more music .

The foam cover on them has completely deteriorated and i can't find anywhere that sells a replacement .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is among the best I have ever heard . The cord is extremely long and great for any distance that you might need these phones for . The headband design doesn't keep the drivers  close enough to my ears for low bass . The screw-on 1\/4&quot; plug adaptor is very well designed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is THE BEST I have found no matter the price range . The winding case helps avoid the usual wire failures . They sound good, not great, but I'm fine with making the trade for durability and convenience . I've replaced my previous two pair was because I lost them!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The MDR-V900s are very comfortable and have outstanding build quality, but the sound quality is really bad, especially considering the price tag . For what they cost, the lack of excellent sound is totally inexcusable . A pair of Grado SR-60s or Sennheiser HD497s will embarrass the Sony V900s .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The left\/right channel cords tend to tangle up and stay tangled right above the volume control . Not sized for adults, would fit kids fine .

{"text":" Sony MDR-V300 Traditional Collapsible DJ Style Headphones are better than $20 headphones, and worse than $80 headphones . The earpads are rather small, causing these to press against my ears in ways that grow painful over time . The headphone jack is gold plated for better conductivity .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best headphones I've used, I love that they don't have that much bass(I find it annoying and not enjoyable) Cable is super long(coil) and really comfortable . Sony quality still stands and I look forward to enjoying these another 5 maybe even 6 yrs, especially since the price is to good to beat .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony MDR-V700DJ headphones have an appealing look . The sound quality is crisp, pure and wonderful . They sound great, with a lot of emphasis in the lower end . Alternately Sennheiser HD 280 Pro or Koss a\/130 are worth a look at .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of the Sony MDR-V600 headphones is substantially better than average . The bass response is rather lacking in the set . The sound is subtle but still obviously present, while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my MacBook Pro .

{"text":" The remote works great for Sony TV, VCR, DVD Player, and Sony Receiver with Surround Speakers . Base is a bigger than most remotes, which makes it much easier to reach the buttons . The remote is not learning and has no macro buttons .

{"text":" The floppies work just fine for storing data with vintage music gear like the Yamaha EX5 or Akai S-series samplers . The labels included are of very low quality, won't stick, and got caught in the reader . Sony is kind of stingy with the labels - they are only half size .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is the best of any IR or RF unit, but the clicking noise drives me insane .

{"text":" The sound seemed poor, and I received some static even after changing channels .

{"text":" Sony MDR-CD230 is no longer available . $64 V6 stands out for 2 things - the richness and accuracy of the sound outside the office .

{"text":" The system is really loud and has excellent sound on all channels when in DTS 5.1 (DVDs and Digital Cable) The tuner is very accurate and I rarely get interference, something common in all other radios in my house . The remote on the  Kenwood 2080 is conversation piece .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The part of the headphones that touch your ears is made of HARD PLASTIC . No cushioning at all, and sadistically uncomfortable .

{"text":" The device works great, the price was good . It is in great shape as advertised . Was packaged well, and on time .

{"text":" Sangean ATS 606AP is a nice little radio for the money . Sound quality is terrific, considering it is a single driver of maybe 2.5&quot;. Sound is full, dynamic, lively, remarkably rich, and very fast . The sensitivity means capturing stations 75+ miles away is a common occurence .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SG-622 offers both AM and FM, but only for the shortwave . The only thing this picked up in multiple listening sessions was three or four religious broadcasts that probably are readily available on AM radio .

{"text":" Sangean ATS 909 is loaded with almost every feature a shortwave listener would want... even SSB (single sideband) reception by using a built in BFO (beat frequency oscillator) switch for upper... and lower sideband .

{"text":" This is a quality product with excellent sound, that has been in production for many years .

{"text":" Reception is better than I expected and,I agree,the wire length of the earbuds is inconvenient . FM sound is excellent with the Bass Boost! For the money this is a great buy! Initially I liked the unit but I found the reception very poor . I live in an isolated area so I can pick up only 4 local stations .","product_category":"Electronics"}

JBL does not honor its 5-year warranty unless bought through an authorized online dealer . They are large for bookshelf speakers, and not light .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a fantastic system for the ultimate movie (especially DVD) experience . The center channel can pump out 150 watts, while the sattelites can handle up to 100 watts .

{"text":" The foldable part is not a good reason to buy these headphones . The sound quality of these headphones is stellar . The headphones themselves are much more fragile than a lot of headphone sets . The one draw back is that it is a cheap set . one of the ear pieces tends to die out quickly .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Grundig Traveller II PE is a great, inexpensive and yet a good radio receiver . Good signal reception on all bands . Long battery life using only 2 AA batteries (3V system) with a completely separate system for the clock and its display . Available SW band frequencies are quite limited by current standards .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The build quality was excellent, and everything worked perfectly on the first power-on . Rotational speed accuracy is incredible (practically almost no wow and flutter) The sound of a good LP is something that's lost on this generation, and I really enjoyed listening to music that was fluid, punchy, crisp and warm .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The weight of the turntable is practically anti-resonant (unless you slam your fist on it)! The sound quality of the 1200 is quite poor because of the components that pass the sound out . There are no unnecessary bells and whistles or extra gears that would make this any kind of an automatic 'table'","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The FL8370 5-CD changer did not work right out the box . Amazon's customer service people were very nice, they sent me another machine immediately and accepted the first machine with a full refund . The replacement unit worked fine for a while, it produces fantastic sound . But after a few uses, the same power failure occurred .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" HK AVR500 has crystal clear dynamic dynamic Dolby Digital & DTS sound incredible power . The remote is terrible, the user on screen display user interface is very unfreindly .

It does not have an input for phono .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Harmon Kardon CDR2 lives up to its reputation in terms of music quality . It was easy to set up and could easily record off both CD as well as audio cassettes . The two features that I would like to see (but missing) are multiple CD capability on the play side .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This sub is similar to the Audio Source 200 Watt 15-inch subwoofer but heavier by a bit, a little larger and louder . It does an exceptional job handling the ultra-low end, which is what I have it doing (100Hz and lower) It does, however, tend to get a bit sloppy on some types of music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It does not come with an extra S-Video\/RCA cable to go from the box to the TV, so if you don't have one, be sure to pick one up at the same time . The one disadvantage is having to get up and go over to the unit to change the selection .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fellowes 224 CD Wallet has strong, hard frame forming the face, back and spine of the wallet . The quality of the sewing is very robust and the pages can easily take the weight of 8 discs .

{"text":" Great buy for anyone looking for capacity for many CDs . Pockets were tight and it would be very easy to scratch a dvd on the zipper . The packing was also top notch as always and it arrived promptly . The album is also at a convenient location next to the stereo system and it is also mobile .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The adapters make this product non-functional for me . With some wiggling I could get sound to flow through the device, but cables were too loose to maintain the signal if it were bumped or even after switching to another input .

The cables messed up my sound card doing that, pulled the RCA jacks right out of the card, so make sure u got a tough device .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster Cable IDL 100 Interlink Datalink 100 coaxial digital cable . The difference in the sound is incredible!!!

{"text":" Toslink (opical) is by far the worst interface, both mechanically (the physical connection between cable and jack) and electrically (it has the lowest bandwidth) Toslink conncetion tends to blur the separation between individual instrument images, adds a layer of grunge over instrumental textures, softens the bass .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The cable is heavy, and is 20 ft long . It is strong without clich\u00e9s in the connection . The molded base of the 3.5mm jack is almost as big as my MP3 player . The cable works great, but the minijack portion could be a bit stronger .","product_category":"Electronics"}

These are my powerstrips of choice, because of the super long cords and the angled plug that allows for tigh fits behind appliances, desks, dressers, etc...","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The PowerCenter is an excellent item to purchase if you have multiple electronics to plug in at one central location . The eight receptacles have been helpful to get the cable, internet, TV, & Sound System plugged in . Like the spacing for adapters and the extra long cord as typical w\/monster adapters .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The company guarantees all of your plugged in equipment for full replacement should it fail . The color scheme is not a fan of the color scheme, but if you have room to hide it, it's not an issue . The labeled plugs are nice, too, and labeled plugs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Powercentre is well made, technical specs match the official Amazon review, has a decent manual, and comes complete with short lengths of decent SV1 video cable & telephone cable . The imaging improved, the bass response is much lower and smoother . No boom, just so much better all the way around .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is money well spent if you would get some type of a power surge protector . Nice, sturdy design . Doesn't flip on its side like narrow surge protectors do, and it has a nice long cord so it can be positioned around your entertainment center wherever you want it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The device is easy to use and effective at doing its job . It is a good way to keep the noise from coming from the inside . It's a great way to make sure you don't have to wait for the next few months to get the device . The device has been tested and tested successfully .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The plug is a wall-hugging 90-degree angle type that can be used in either the top or bottom outlet receptacle . It can be hung in virtually any direction (horiz, diag, vert) from two screws\/nails by two plus-sign (+) hole patterns on the back of the unit .","product_category":"Electronics"}

Lighted switch and protection lights are easy to see (useful if you turn it off after use) Wishes the plug was angled directly down or at least swiveled for better flexibility .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only issue I have with this product is that the picture shown looks like bare wire and would need to re-wire what ever device your extending . This is not the case, it's just like an extension cord, plug in and your good to go . The right angle plug makes a big difference and is flatter (19mm \/ 3\/4&#34; thick) than other designs I have found .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster cables are super with my new DVD player . There is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment . The cables themselves are really made well, they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt .

{"text":" The MV3CV-2M Monster Video 3 High-Resolution Component Video Cable 2 Meters in length is the BEST off the shelf product available . This gas filled double sheilded cable with duraflex jacket eliminates ghost and brings the sharpest, most colorful and brightest picture possible to your screen .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster Cable made a world of difference! There was virtually NO signal leakage or interference . The only way to surpass this cable is to spend much more on ultra-high-end cables . Be careful with Monster's plugs: the pins break easily, and the fit is way too tight .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster's MVS3-1M cable snaps the picture into such clarity that you'll think you're watching scenes through a glass window . Signal loss on 2 data wires = ~.05 Ohms from pin to pin . Signal Loss on 2 (distinct) ground wires = .06 Ohms, pin topin .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is only for Satellite Speakers center speakers or small towers or small stereo surround sound speakers . The wires are not white, they are a dark bone color .

{"text":" SS4RF is slightly better than the 2GHz model for cable TV . It made absolutely no difference what so ever. Don't waste your money on this! For cable(digital,analog,HD,HD) the SS4 RF can't be beat! The best splitter you can get .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is an excellent investment if you are looking to improve the picture on your TV set . Price is not an issue because you will be paying for quality and for a better picture . Advantages: less noise and grain than others I've used, and channels at the frequency band extremes look much better than my cable company's piece of junk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This splitter was set-up as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house . The picture quality is crystal clear, even when almost all of the ports are in use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Great deal for a Monster Cable Splitter compared to Best Buy or any other major electronics store . Costco is the only other place to buy . Monster has always charged more for their products because they are well made and last longer than those of their competitors . The premium price reflects the quality of the product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster Cable XP speaker wire is excellent home theater \/ audiophile wiring . Thick-gauge and high-quality crafstmanship allows for a better signal .

{"text":" Samsung YP-E32 Yepp Mp3 player is small, lightweight and pleasent looking . It can hold 2 hours of music and voice . It also has a digital screen .

{"text":" VCR tapes are so out of date they are constantly going up in price because getting harder to find . If you need them, better snatch some before they go the way of 8-tracks . They hold up very well to repeated copying . Amazon also sell those Tapes for a lot less .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only way I could listen to any of the music was in the Classic DSP mode . There's not enough amplification to make some songs loud enough . The player freezes every time you use it and the software freezes . The DSP modes are pathetic, the sound quality is terrible .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only coasters I've made have been my own fault, and they work in my home CD player, DVD, and both cars . The 700 MB limit is great, as well as the 16x speed capability . The price per disk can't be bettered, and the quality of the first 50 I got was 100% perfection .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex CD-R's work flawlessly in my audio recorder, unlike Philipp's own CDR's . The audio CDR has a superior  sound quality than those burned on a PC CD-RW . These CD-Rs work on any  home\/car\/portable CD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic RPHT 355 headphones for their 16.4 ft (5 m.) long cord . TV sound is OK, but static requires almost constant tuning of earphones . The stated operating range of up to 150` is a bit exaggerated . Some static within just a few feet is more like 1.5 feet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Manual included is barren, very basic and not all too informative, providing simply diagrams for connection . It features a nice crossover, auto on\/off and volume control - plus two separate methods of connecting it: one through speaker chain and one method for a direct connection from receiver .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA Lyra is an amazing mp3 player . It has good sound, durable casing, and great transfer speeds . The only problems I have experienced is that the battery intake is very high . With a 128MB card, I can fit over 20 songs in the highest quality format .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Lyra MP3 player has excellent sound quality and putting songs on the card is as easy as can be . The drawbacks, however, exist on the player itself . There is nothing to prevent the buttons from being pushed in my pocket, which will either turn it on and drain my batteries when it is off .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Nomad's sound for playing music is  excellent, and the included ear buds are quite good . It has long battery life because, unlike some players, it has space for two AAA sized batteries . Many of my minor complaints, such as the lack of USB support, lack of future proofing, and playback of only MP3 files, will be addressed by the now overdue Nomad II .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The IJ100 MP3 player can be gotten cheap, but expect to pay an arm and a leg for memory . The sound is as good as a CD, and the radio also sounds good . For the price the quality of the player can't be beat . Expect to pay  more than 3 mp3 songs\/16MB card .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit does not come with a remote so if you don't have a JVC receiver to hook it to (with compulink system) in order to use one remote, I'd suggest another model . The unit responds to the remote control somewhat hesitently, but always comes through .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Pioneer's recommendation that, if  be moved, it should be unloaded\/reloaded rather than be transported full . A second unit can be combined to provide a total storage of 600+2--which implies I could increase my library by another 200 discs . I like it better than the Sony 300 that failed after eight light use years .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The on\/off\/flash wheel is very loose . The pictures are very small so take this into account . If you take a picture with a dozen people, they all come out to be the size of dots . The only thing that I have noticed that I didn't like was that it distorts images if it is too close to the subject .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Buyer Beware! Beautiful sound capability but the 3-CD drawer or tray broke after 24 calendar hours of use! The very fancy mechanism that pulls CD's in and out broke, and ate my CD! There IS NO TECH SUPPORT FROM PIONEER! You may be better off with a less fancy, single tray unit . Sound quality is quite good, most appealing quality is the ability to project a large soundstage .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is incredible, the interface easy, and the software top quality . The headphones that come with it are decent and comfortable . The radio is another great feature, there are very few mp3 players that are of this quality with a radio . The docking software doesn't support playlists and the selection tools for picking songs are a little clunky .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Good sound for the money; however, it is sensitive to bouncing . The player would not be good for jogging, because it skips a little when you jog . It's an excellent gift for a young child, who doesn't need a top-of-the-line player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Only gripes are about the memory (too small, too expensive), headphones (don't fit in your ears brilliantly) and volume . Sound quality is very good, packaging is sharp, and the parallel cable is sufficient . But if you want to record more than 8 - 12 songs, forget it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Some of the CD's tend to skip for no apparent reason, never in the same place . Some songs clumped together is what you get if you don't sit thru the recording session with the remote in hand for 74 min. You can't change tracks manually on analog recordings . The best part is that you can play these CD's almost anywhere .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality isint the best but its a great bargain, who wants to spend [alot more] for  sound only a little bit better . The anti-skip memory, a battery draining feature, must be used at all times . I doubt any player will hold up to the rigors of true running .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SL-SW505Y has great staying power, and you can listen to CDs for hours before the power gets low . The sound is also excellent quality with the right mix of bass and treble . Panasonic means what they say when they advertise the &quot;anit-shock protection .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic has programmable track memory, bass boost function and lasts approx. 28 hours on two AA batteries . It weighs less than half a pound, sounds great, and plays CD-Rs . The only so-so thing about the player is it's not very loud .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Aiwa portable CD player is small, has good sized navigation buttons, and works well . The display does not have a back-light, so if you use your player in dark places, you may want to consider a different model . The sound quality is much better than my big sony boombox .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The anti-skip on the CD part of the player could not be better, except it skips when jogging . Radio reception with this player is superb . The buttons may be inconvenient but they are extrememly easy to use . The only problem I've ever had with it is that the handgrip just doesn't stay on and the headphones broke .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The anti-shock needs to build up for 40 seconds at the beginning of every track or each time you return from pause . The bass-boost makes barely any difference . The included headphones are of typical &quot;street style style style in terms of sound and brittle plastic construction .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony makes a pretty lousy portable CD player . It skips excessively . The right side of headphones don't work . Sony-brand gives you a sense of trust in the product, making you lose it on many occasions .  This CD player is nothing but a pieace of junk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only reason why i did not give this player 5 stars is because of the volume it does not play very loud . With the ESP on it takes alot of knocking around to get this player to skip . From rap to punk to rock to classical, it all sounds great in this player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The bass is excellent, and the features are cool . The resume feature lets you start a song where you left off, even when you turn the thing off . The head phone jack became broke and would only play out of one head phone . The only thing I don't like is that the ear phones sometimes pull my hair but they have very good sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The player skids even without any shaking or movement and it is impossible to hear a track properly . The headphones provided were discomforting to my ears . The player skiped the first time that I went running with it . It comes with a running pouch so I figured it was the perfect player to go jogging with . It was not, so I am sending it back .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The reception is extremely good for FM and specially for AM . The alarms are easy to set with forward and backward capability . Some reviews have complained about the display being weak, but we see nothing wrong with it . The sound is excellent and reception is excellent . The only thing I would have changed in the design (because I'm so lazy) is to have a longer snooze increment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is an excellent pocket-sized radio for toting along to the ballgame, carrying along on a hike or to the park . It won't fill a room with sound - it's not intended to - but it plays loud enough to listen to from a few feet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speaker clarity is great, it picks up the local stations great, and the CD player is awesome . Installation was no problem - I did it myself using the easy to follow instructions . All controls are mechanical (basic sliders for the radio band selects, pulleys and string for the tuner) They are adequate but remind me of the 1970s .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only thing I dislike about it is that the buttons are in the wrong place and difficult to press . The numbers on the clock display are a little small and tend to fade out at extreme angles . The speakers are better than most bedside radios, and waking up to any specific CD track of your choice is a treat .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The midranges are noticably depressed and the highs are muted . The rubber at the top of the headband doesn't seem to be enough to keep them on your (my) head if I happen to bend over . These headphones have a lot of bass, but what bass there is is is mushy and undefined .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sennheiser HD433 headphones have a rich bass that sounds good with most popular music . The over the ear method of delivering sound does not do as well as wrap around or in the ear phones for limiting sound to the individual that is listening to the music . For routine music listening it is hard to go wrong with these headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sennheiser HD490 are not good on todays portable players for that reason . They are not for hearing loud loud music because of distortions but for enjoying a not coloured sound spectrum . The more you set them on, the more you will appreciate them for their real sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound from these headphones is really nice, especially for the price that amazon.com provided . They sound great through my home system and I use them at work with my Sony Walkman CD player . The ear cushions are very comfortable and the way the earpieces swivel I am sure they will fit any odd-shaped skull .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 570 is the best fitting headphone I ever encountered . The craftsmanship for the 570 is well design . No sound from any other headphones has equaled my sound preference as the 570 has . The 570 almost match the high fidelity of the tower but not the surreal bass that a tower can produce .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sennheiser 580 and 590 headphones are the most comfortable open headphones I have ever tried . The 590 don&#8217;t need a dedicated amp, at only 120 ohms nominal impedance, they are easy to drive even from laptops, portables and other low output sources . Some people think the treble is inexplicably sharp and intrusive, probably making these more adequate for jazz and classical .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This player is very sleek, modern, and entertaining to watch with its cool blue light and sliding glass door . One reviewer mentioned that his cat enjoyed it--and after a while I found it was not good for much more than amusing pets . The sound quality suffers noticably at high volumes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Stereo mode makes the wall on the opposite side of the room quiver! Sound is clear and never too bright . Midnight mode suppresses all audio signals as they are processed by the receiver . No component video hook-ups, and no S-Video switching, so you can't hook up any video components with S-VHS .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SC-AK18 is best cost performance audio system . It's got slick looks with a really cool front panel, sound quality is very good and has quite a lot of features packed into this price . The only drawback: the CD changer clanks around when it accesses a disk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic has the highest disc-capacity, the best sound and the Super-Woofers give out a SUPERB bass sound that will simply blow you away . The multi-fuction display is large and easy to read, as well as looking great . The remote has everything you need to just sit back and enjoy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The eGo can load an IBM microdrive for a whopping 340mb of storage space, or 680mb if you buy two microdrives and the optional Compact Flash Expansion Slot . The only complaint is that the earbuds are only provided to get a set of headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" iGo does not even come with a manual to tell you how to use it . Customer service has regular business hours EST. Customer support is lacking. The company that makes the eGo is out of business . The sound is the best thing about the iGo...great sound...it rocks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Ceiva doesn't repair the units, has no way of doing so, and you'll go through a maze of uninformed GenY-ers in a futile effort to get any two that have the same sheet to talk from . It's like buying a car from a dealer with no service department .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The YEPP is the lightest and smallest audio player you can buy . The only downside is the parallel cable which is really slow . The LCD screen is extremely easy to use . The voice recording and phone book are very handy . The design could be better (Rio 600)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips Rush MP3 player chews its 2 AAA up in 1.5 hours or less .

{"text":" You wont find a better mp3 player then the Diamond Rio 600 . The display is nice and clear, with an impressive backlit feature .

Marantz was no help in fixing, replacing or giving advice on the problem and I didn't want to spend a lot or money trying to fix .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This kit is touted as a good 3-pc setup for those that have a home theatre amplifier but only the front two speakers . The center speaker (used for most midrange including voice) leaves a lot to be desired . Misses that rich sound you should have from a speaker .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The KLH Basbite II is solidly built and a very good value for the money . The best bang (or should I say boom) for the buck I've seen on the market for a small subwoofer . It's small enough to fit just about anywhere, can fill a moderate size room .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" For a beginning DVD enthusiast this more than fits the bill to upgrade any stereo system you might have . For the price, it delivers crisp, audible dialogue that will  enhance your viewing pleasure . The only problem that I had  with this speaker is that when you have your center channel standardized  it drowns out your rear and front speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Wharfedale Emerald 93 speakers have the cleanest, most transparent, warm and sweet sound I've ever heard come from any speaker . They produce more bass than a box that size normally would (due to the ported design) but without it being over powering or boomy . The sound stage they produce is well defined and sounds three dimensional .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality is outstanding in every area: design (still British), materials (quality wood veneers---even on the bottom of the plinth!), and assembly . These speakers have one of the finest tweeters I've ever come across right out of the box . Don't be frightened off by the 'Made in China' buzz out there...","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers might not do as well in a larger room, and they get a little muddy if the volume is cranked up too high . For smaller spaces, they deliver nice sound at an unbeatable price . The sound was sort of boxy, the highs muddled and the midrange subdued .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are the perennial #1 selling loudspeakers in England and are manufactured by the same parent company that makes the legendary Quad ESL electrostatics . The speakers have a warm, very natural sound and the soundstage is very believable . Room positioning is crucial for these speakers to sound their best .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Soft silk tweeter is one of the smoothest I have ever heard . Bass is tight, detailed and goes as low as most people need, excellent imaging at all volumes . Soft silk tweeters are soft and smooth . I listen to Led ZeP to Pat Metheny to Vivaldi and the Diamonds really sing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The soundfield is open, airy, and extended . The high frequency detail is extended, sweet, and non-metallic . The only shortcoming is that these bad boys use a lot of power . I recommend at least a good 35 WPC (watt per channel), DC capable, low distortion amp .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only downside is that it takes two AA for a 15-hour playback, when current ones render more with one AA . The only bad thing is  there is no remote but I was able to live with that . It is chunky, doesn't have a remote control or back-lit display but for less ($$$)you get a simple way to record your favourite music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This player is of horrible quality and I would encourage anyone to buy a sony over sharp's bad quality . The adapter is basically a fancy cable that connects your computer's sound card to the  line-in jack on your player . The first few seconds of a song can be cut off, or pauses in a track can be misinterpreted as the end of the song .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer: \"If you want an inexpensive CD\/RADIO\/Cassette; then buy it.  If you expect it to last....forget it! The player ate a tape, so the tape player and the tape are ruined . The player on this was execelent and despite other reports say it was perfedctly clear and the speakers were also good .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price is right for this portable CD player, but it lacks the quality one might get for a few dollars more . Sound quality is mediocre; there seem to be glitches in the track reading every so often . The ear phones work well but are fragile, but who buys a CD Player for the ear phones?","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" 24X zoom works really great and with a good place to hold your arms you will not have any trouble with the shaking (24X zoom means if you move a little bit your hands the image moves many little bits). You should try to see fullmoon through this glasses and you will see what i'm talking about .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable, reliable, blank VHS tapes to record television shows . The company's attitude towards the fact that the tapes don't work is they are glad that they ripped you off . The best image quality will be at shorter recording times (the three hour recording time gives you the best picture, some say .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The door comes off the same day Fisher Price gave it to my son as a gift for Christmas 2000 . The microphone does not stay in its place when not in use, the door does not come out far enough for an adult to easily take tapes out, let alone a toddler . The buttons are difficult to push and the buttons are hard to push .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These speakers sound great for the price, but you do need a sub to make up for the high cut off in the frequency response . They can handle quite a lot of volume without distorting the sound whatsoever . Don't even think of getting these speakers without either having or planning on getting a powered suwoofer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These speakers included wall mount brackets that make them excellent for side or rear surround speakers . They don't have much in the bottom end, but the main speakers pick up that load . They have great highs and mids, but are missing the bass, but that was why it came with a sub .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" With anti-shock on it seems impossible to skip . The included headphones are suprisingly at least somewhat respectable . As with all portables you should still get a better pair . The sound reproduction is terrific, despite the fact that the SLCTCT470 has been designed to be battery-conserving .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic CD player is superb in every way . The sound quality is excellent . Anti-shock memory feature means no skipping as you run for the bus . Remote control is a great bonus to this set, allowing you to operate the main controls while jogging or walking without having to fumble for the player itself .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The panasonic panasonic CD player is a portable player with external speakers and anti-shock feature . The sound is vastly improved when wearing earphones, but that is too dangerous while bicycling . The skip protection is awesome, the player slid off my seat and started playing ping-pong around my mom's minivan without skipping a beat .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic's SL-SW60 CD player is the finest piece of machinery known to mankind . Reviewer: \"She is more of a man than I'll ever be, which is impressive because I had previously been referring to her as a she. She loves life and she refuses to die\"","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic makes way better cd player than Sony, no comparision, in quality  and price . Price is high compared to other players, but when you use one almost every day, its worth it . AM\/FM radio appealed to me; for some reason its  tough to find players that have this great feature .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave CD Players are the most durable and highest quality CD players on the market today . The durability is quite amazing, it can take a large amount of beating and dropping, yet still keep playing . The headphones hurt my head and ears after 5 minutes of putting them on, and apparently, my VMSS didn't even work .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SLSW880K has the best sound system you can imagine . The player skips sometimes on a slight move and is complicated to use . The remote control feature on the headphones is pretty nifty . Maximum volume on the unit is  much too low and the construction of this player is not as sturdy as the description would have you believe .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave player is a great looking player; but a great all around portable portable . The sound is very good, and the only downfall is, the head-set gets uncomfortable after awhile . The headphones that come with the Shockwave leave something to be desired . The earpieces are too big to fit inside my ears .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The size of the headphones is too small, it can fit to your ears but it hurts a little bit . The ear phones has a sharp round shape so if u move alot it can hurt your ears . If the Panasonic can fix the headphones problem , u can say that this product is worth enough for 70 dollars u pay .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Boombox- RXES25 is not in stock right now, but i recommend you to get that one instead . Sony CFD-ZW755 is the best and most powerful sound i've ever heard from a Sony model . While the volume may not be loud enough for some uses, it's pretty good as a bedside stereo .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic PowerBlaster RX-ES25 is a great boombox . It plays very loud and does not distort the music even at full volume . Sound Virtulizer gives the music 3D sound, and the preset equalizer settings even add more character to music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound of a baseball or football game on a cool Fall day is like heaven . Hard to find a better deal. Buy one of these and some akalai batteries and you will never purchase another radio . It is so small and does not take up much space in your beach bag .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony SRFM78 is a great motivator for anyone getting into an exercise routine . It's light, with a velcro strap, it stays snug on your arm, and it has a lock switch that prevents  accidently draining the battery . The only problem is that the headphones that go in your ears are too big for me .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" At half the price of the Sony, this armband is well worth it . FM performance of this unit is quite good . But AM sensitivity is poor on all but the strongest stations . The radio has many presets for stations and is very lightweight and has many preset stations .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave Arm Band Radio is the best sports-related radio out there . Reception is good, features are good but sometimes lose reception a little too easily . Panasonic should check out Bang &amp; Olufsen's Ear Phones and then design something that is more state-of-the-art and comfortable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SC-PM03 is easy to use, looks great and has a very very strong tuner . It's a fairly low powered unit, but it makes good use of it's 15 watts per channel . The finish and constuction isn't quite as nice as some of JVC's &quot;executive systems .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speaker wires are hard-wired into the back of the speakers . The sound is awesome and it is the most convenient thing to have a CD and DVD with speakers . I would recommend this to anyone who wants convenience, great sound, awesome visuals and all in one box .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The R100s sound great, shield the external noise very well, and are very comfortable to wear . The closed earcups let you hear bass far better than open air designs . One of the cords has inline 3D mixing device, which Koss calls a Phase II control . The bad things about the product are about what you would expect .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones are a terrific bargain for less than $5.00 . They are finicky and unadjustable . They hurt so much when I use them that I have to take them off and not use them for at least an hour before putting them on again .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Good sound quality, good durability and comfortable to wear over a period of time . Volume control is set quite close to the earphones so, unless you let the lines dangle in front of you, there's a lot fumbling around the neck trying to find the volume control . Not really the best product out there, but for the price, you can't beat it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is pretty good, and they fold up nicely . The only observation is that the midrange and treble are slightly lower, but not limiting to the overall sound . The in-cord volume control is a very handy feature . The cord is fairly short, and not great if you want to hook into the speaker jack on the back of the tower case .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" E.A.S. Plus 40 second electronic antishock system is excellant . Easy to read LED display which shows a battery symbol of how much juice is left instead of a beep or flashy battery icon . It sounds great although the headphones are flimsy and lack bass a tad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best feature is the rechargable batteries,  which last for a long time . The skip protection is great, but if you are looking for the same anti-skip protection...you can look to a cheaper model . One flaw that I had was the headphones, two days after receiving the player, they stopped working .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The green Koss is a safe, sound buy, unless you plan on toying with the headphones or pulling at the door while listening to a CD . The door does not easily snap off (I don't know how one would get it off except to pull it backwards manually). Nor does it open while playing CDs; it's just as sturdy as any other .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" 40 second anti-skip,ac adapter and headphones makes it a great buy for its price . It only runs on two AA batteries . It has a hold button, so if you have annoying sibling that thinks it is funny to change your song or stop the payer, they cant do it . Good sound, not scratchy at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The film doesn't work. I've tried numerous times and not a single image comes out instead I get a smear of grey ink.. I'm not sure if the person I purchase this from kept the film in the appropriate room temperature . Bottom line a waste of money. I still have some expired iZone film and it's basically useless .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The player is barely larger in circumfrence than a CD and it's very light too . It only took two batteries and that the  lasted for up to 32 hours! It also comes with an AC adapter so you don't even have to use the batteries . The headphones that come with it are very basic and i do not like them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The D-EJ915 is housed in a sleek, rugged aluminum case . The thinnest, smallest, and lightest discman in the world with a beautiful aluminum case that is barely bigger than the CD itself . It offers Sony's new G-Protection anti-skip system .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SADX930 runs hot and is probably a fire hazard . The receiver is the best product ever designed by technics . The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star is because it never has been able to play DTS, it always detects dolby digital 5.1 but not the DTS .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only weird glitch that I encountered was a skip in a CD-RW that I recorded; however, when I made copies of the CD- RW, the skip disappeared on the copies . Other pluses include the volume control on the headphone jack, which is not available on cheaper models . The instruction manual is the worst I have ever seen .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" TDK tapes are the best tapes currently on the market in terms of quality and durability . Two out of the 10 tapes were defective, but when compared with other brands of tapes (Maxcell, Sony, etc) The new technology of disks is tough to find VHS tapes in any store .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Ravemp2200 is probably the best mp3 player on the market because it's small and has the greatest memory capacity available in its price range . It uses a USB connection to transfer files which is really fast and so much better than the parrallel port mp3 players around . The only drawback is that it doesn't work on Macs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The display is too bright for bedside use, even in the 'dim' position, and a 'seconds' display would be useful . Out of the box the clock refused to synchronize with the atomic clock in Colorado . A long antenna cable would permit better reception adjustment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic's CD30 is one of the most perfect combinations of storage, display and portability for CDs . Plastic display case is split in two, with eleven thin slots on each side . You can also invert the storage axis, ignoring the slots, and use it to store about 14 DVDs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Case Logic CD60 case is extremely versatile - carry CDs of every description with or without the jewel cases . It holds the full jewel cases, not just the slim cases . The nylon outer fabric is durable and the zippers seem sturdy . The lid flap opens and closes from side to side instead of opening at the bottom .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the largest Case Logic CD Wallet ever made, holding a whopping 256 CD's . The case does seem to have minor problems being picked up by the handle when the case is completely full . Not a terrible product, but could certainly use a re-noodling for version 2 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ties are long enough to handle a large bunch of power, ethernet, etc cables but work equally well if you only have two or three . The different colors are helpful to mark certain cables for quick reference . They work as well as you can expect for $2 velcro straps .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Light but very rugged and easy to clean . Works well with any CD player . External headphone jack allows easy plug-and-play access to player . Zippered compartment is perfect for storing CDs and accessories . Easy-to-use case is one of those cases that looks like it will never wear out .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The DVA40 case looks good, but functionally it's awkward to use . The flaps tend to stay open and your DVDs fall out, and it begins to create folds in the covers that are near impossible to get out of the case . The case is worthless, but the flaps make zippering the case up a pain in the neck .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Binders fit two different types of bindings; the band-type and also the standard 3-ring . Binder packs are priced at $1.80 for each page . Binders are still the best way to go if you have a ton of DVDs, if not the most economical .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The wallet has a nice carrying handle with a see-through slit to insert a label . The pages are attached like a book cover - front and back plastic pages slide into the cover's interior slits . The plastic sleeves for the disc are durable and strong enough for regular use but won't scratch the surface of the disc .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The storage case is fairly sturdy and they stack nicely . There are gaps above and below in the box which limit the capacity to 22 individual CDs . The slots are simply unnecessary: widely-spaced dividers will maintain the composure of your CD pile just as securely . The darn slots are a chronic nuisance if you believe in organizing your CD's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The clock malfunctions and gains\/loses time . The CD player then stopped working and, shortly thereafter, the radio as well . The alarm became unreliable (not exactly a desired feature in an alarm clock). The alarm quit altogether . With a 90 day warrantee this is now mostly worthless .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Bass is favored here over high treble or midrange frequencies, so if you have an equalizer on your computer or music playing device, it might help . These are easily worth twice what they're going for . For 99.99 percent of you out there looking for this STYLE\/TYPE of headphones, but aren't Bill Gates, you can't go wrong here .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic pair is soft, light, compact, secure but not tight . Sound is more live and present, along with brighter treble and less boomy bass . It's too much cord for my purposes. Save your money and buy a higher-end pair of headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sennheiser PX 100's are not only more compact and convenient but provide sound that is so superior I'm no longer fretting about the inglorious end of my 850's . The only flaw, which is minor, is the cord, it could be longer!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sound quality is as good as standard foam on-ear headphones--not fabulous-- but for the features at the price (I paid about $35) I'm very happy! They fold up well being careful being careful . They cancels out deep sounds, like the sound of a car engine, but unfortunately doesn't do anything to more normal sounds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only adjustable part of the headphone is where you can place the earhole, and that rotates in and out . The only downside for the headphones is the foam covers that foam covers the earphone covers . Reviewer says the headphones don't fit every head perfectly .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is frequently quite poor, especially in the extremes of tenor and bass . The only decent feature on this stereo is the CD player . The buttons and knobs are cheap, and ill responsive . The sound is tinny and very poor, unless listening 5 feet directly in front of the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Casio PZ860B personal CD player has a 20-track programmable memory . The player also features repeat play functions (1\/all), bass boost, and a two-digit LCD screen . It does not come with a car adapter, probably with good reason, as it skips a great deal .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a great multifunction calculator, but check the size before you order . It does have some additional features that are not mentioned on the included documents . Solar power has preserved the battery nicely, it's still ticking after a couple years of use . This is the best retail business calculator we have been able to find .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony Portable CD\/Cassette\/Radio Boombox is just the right size for my classroom . It sounds tinny because of the thin plastic speaker enclosers . The only component that is not to my liking is the knob on the left that searches for the correct song .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" G-Protection CD player has the best sound I've ever heard on CD players . Sound is great and plenty loud for me. Easy to use the CD in the carrying case as you do your evening walk . Easy to turn off the player when you want to, but switch is well hidden under the lid .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony customer service was slow to respond to the problems of the MZE60 . This is the only one I am allowed to sell on Amazon.com . The only thing that was good about the player was the sound quality . Each product broke conveniently after the warranty expired .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a good choice for an office radio because the small size makes it easy lock in a drawer each night . The controls are not quick to find (for example: I always have to look for the CD play mode button) and not the easiest to understand . The CD player is the worst I have used .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips M55 Mini-CD Mini-Fi System can play 10 hours of music on one CD . Sound quality is excellent with a variety of sound settings &amp; adjustments .

{"text":" This stereo system fills your room with the sound of music, news, or whatever you want to listen to .

With the press of a few buttons, you can easily record tracks from one CD to your own .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" MX980D is the best system philips has made yet! It makes DVD movies come to life as if you've never seen them before! 'Hall' mode sounds good with stereo music, doesn't modify the L-R channels, simply adds an ambience based on the difference between them . The only weak link would have to be the subwoofer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony WM-FS420 Sports Walkman costs $5.95 . The sound boost to normal and Mega Bass give it an impressive sound . The switch for changing one side of a cassette to the other side is extra sensitive . Good luck finding another for $6.95.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony DEJ815 CD Walkman is compact, lightweight, and sounds decent enough for everyday play . Sound quality is awesome, but the hold button is too easy to push and that makes me mad . Battery life is a complete lie, reviewer says . Most appealing feature of the DeJ815 is the g-protection .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sony D-EJ815 is a top-quality product . The only problem I had was the headphones, so I bought the foldable Sony MDR-A34L headphones . They give you more bass response and they sound much more crisp,loud and clear .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The top plate is a bit on the small side for larger speakers, but it will hold them securely if you use Fun-Tak or Blu-tak or Blue Tac or Blue Tack . Stands are 3-footed, easy to level but not as stable as 4-footed stands .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The turntable works great for a 13in CRT TV that sits on my kitchen counter . We were constantly rotating it from the kitchen to the dining room . It is build very well and turns easily, even with the heavier CRT . The price is also very reasonable - buy it!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The swivel does exactly what it is supposed to do . The spinning mechanism is large enough so that the surface is level even if the TV is forward or back . The rubber feet virtually lock it to the underlying table . The unit is unobtrusive, low and rounded edges give it a finished look .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The swivel stand is easy to install and center under the TV . The stand does not look like a cheap piece of junk; it truly looks like I purchased a nice piece of furniture . The turntable allows my 26inch flat Sony TV to angle smoothly for around the room viewing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only thing to keep attention to - is the size of the thing . The price was a little high, but if you need to adjust your large TV, this is the only way to go! The stand was gouged through the thin cardboard box it was packaged in - a small 1\/4 gouge in the most visable spot .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This piece was purchased as an adjunct to the TV turntable--needed somewhere to store the DVR . Side support panel split when we attached it to the base with the screws supplied by the manufacturer . It all swivels at once, easy to point the remote to the front of the devices .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a well manufactured, easily assembled A\/V rack that will serve the budding audiopile for years .

{"text":" This alarm clock is the best out there for the longest time... I am amazed with the sound, it is just awesome! The speakers sound very good (even at low volume) The one knock is that it is very hard to view the the the LCD display (the time) if you are looking at it from underneath the the radio-clock .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best sound was from an older AZ2000\/17 (unfortunately, not purchased from Amazon.com). The CD player quit working in less than two years . I buy Philips because their tuners are unusually strong, and seem to pick up stations with more clarity than any other portable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Clock maintains its accuracy and alarms are easy to set . FM radio is noisy and has poor sensitivity even on strong stations . The green LED display is inappropriate for an alarm clock . The alarm clock will light up your bedroom even on the dimmed setting . For $30, this could be the last clock\/radion you have to buy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The anti-skip plus system makes skiping virtually impossible . It also includes an anti-rolling system, making sure  there is always a 40 second buffer while keeping the sound quailty at optimum . It is stylish, well-built, tough, and well worth the money .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is great, and I've never had a single skip . The position memory takes off at the song I leave off at when I last park the car, which is really nice . My peeve with it is the fact that it takes *so* long to start up .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The AJ396517 is arguably the best CD clock radio out there . Despite boasting a super big blue backlight for easy reading, I find the LCD display often difficult to read . The blue display lights the entire room at night even on the lowest setting . The display begins to fade out at eye level, then completly disappears when viewed lower than eye level .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality was excellent, and the headphones were better than I expected . There's no light for the display so, when it's pitch dark, you have to know where the buttons are . It never skips, dropped it from 3 ft. to a carpet, and there wasn't a skip .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AZ922517 comes with its own headphones, rechargeable battery, and AC adapter . The sound quality is great, but volume isn't loud enough and distorts the sound when turned up . The rechargeable batteries are ok, but they take a while to charge and they don't last long .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" FX277 does a good job at playing all different types of cassette tapes, from pre-recorded albums to blank tapes recorded from CD's . There isn't as much hiss or noise than the old Walkman . With regular cleaning\/demagnitization, you should be able to keep it sound as good as it did the first day you have it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The performance is delightful. Good controls for balance, simple switches for components and even a second line-out for a subwoofer . A very economical way to boot your power amps by increasing a feeble output from your surround\/back amp or revive your surrounds from being drowned by your front\/center speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Amp has 200 watts at 8 ohms bridged . Amp doesn't have internal circuits that detect and turn on and off the amp when a signal comes in .

{"text":" Sony's Dav-s300 is a great little system, great sound and can be set up by anyone! Lack of inputs is the only downside to this machine, otherwise it's great!

{"text":" This is by far the worst dual cassette deck that I have ever purchased . The play back and record have very poor sound quality .

{"text":" The digital display is too small to read at night if you wear glasses or contacts . The lights around the clock dim, but they don't turn off! The choice of alarm sounds is unique . The set up can be confusing so read the directions! The alarm clock is the worst alarm clock I've ever had!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Timex has a battery back-up system (two AAs) so incase you loose electricity, you wouldn't have to reset the time . The alarm sound itself is the best I've ever heard . The display light is inefficient at letting you read the black digits .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says it's the only bad product he ever bought from Costco . The CD player lid opens by itself, lousy reception . The snooze timer goes off after an hour, so if I'm really tired I can't sleep, no more alarm . Buy a Sony instead .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex CD player no longer works after 1 1\/2 months . Reviewer: \"Sure it's cute, but it doesn't work. It's no wonder all the other brands of purple CD players are out! We purchased 2 for these for our grandchildren for Christmas gifts, one blue and one grape .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Koss is a quality full time CD player that can take  alot of abuse . It has never skipped with ASP on, and it even has good skip protection without the ASP on . The controls on the player do not do what they're supposed to do . The player's buttons don't work and it cycles through all of the other modes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This charger is easy to set up, just put the batteries in, and plug it straight into the wall . Charging is usually overnite, it can handle 4 NIMH batteries at a time . The reason this charger can recharge alkalines is that it consistently stops charging at the right point .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Ray-O-Vac is a must have for any one or any family . The ability to recharge these special batteries is what make it a 3-in-1 charger . The charger is very smart; when a battery is charged it shuts off . The main downside is that there is no port for 9v batteries .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" ICF-S10 is a pretty good AM\/FM pocket transistor radio . It has a telescopic antenna for FM that can be extended and pivoted left or right to get the best reception . In strong signal areas it picks up a lot of interference and because of this it won't pull in the distant stations well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The play button is much too sensitive and is in an odd position . The sound is ok but my old, beat up Aiwa runs circles around it . The player drags if the tape is a 90 minute or a worn out tape, the drive is weak to say the least .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Energizer-Eveready 01163 - 6 volt Super Heavy Duty Small Lantern... works great in my flash light, ,really needed this, , really needed this . I bought it because of the price and the unit I have for it is also made by Eveready!! works right out of the box and ordered two just because they were at a great price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This case fits snugly to the PDA, but is not too tight . It does increase the thickness of the unit, but less than most cases . Only downside is with a M125 it can be difficult to get the stylus out . The shortcut buttons are too sensitive .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" At nine+ pounds and with a comfortable handle it should be no problem carrying long distances . A\/C adapter block seems excessively big and can be a bit of a hassle to carry around . The case appears to be very rugged and the rubber foot pads are easy on the counter tops .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This was the best mp3 player i have ever bought . The style is nice and i would get the docking station too . Stay away from this Company products, no support no real solution to customer when you need it . For the money, I'd say it's not worth all the trouble .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Nomad II by Creative Labs is the best MP3 player around, period . It never skips, with no moving parts, and everything about it makes it one of the best products I have ever owned . You get an FM tuner (which you can program to  remember 32 stations!) a voice recording and the earphones with remote control .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The skipping is terrible, but it's good if you just want to sit down and listen . If you move it, it will most likely skip . Another problem is that the headphones are never perfect . The price may be low, but the thing is just plain crappy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Tamrac Pro System 5612 bag fits two full size Canon 5d's with L lenses and other lenses and flash . The inside compartment which holds your bodies and lenses is very customizable to accommodate a variety of bodies, lenses, flashes, etc. The compartment dividers are well constructed from high density foam, the stitching holding the velcro is heavy duty .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The next version of the Jukebox should be great . It needs a bigger drive, maybe 20 gig . I would say people should hold off buying until the next gen of players are on the market . The weird UI is really the only complaint I have with this . The sound is great. Be ready to buy some headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DUO-MP3 can be used as a personal MP3 player with earphones OR through any standard audio cassette deck . It converts digital sound to analog through a built-in converter that provides an extraordinary high-fidelity listening experience . The only problem now is getting it back from my friends when they listen to it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reception of the radio depends on where you are like with many small handheld radios, but in the city I have no trouble at all . The latest firmware addressed more than couple of the downfalls of the player . The ability to update the player thanks to the firmware postings by Creative Labs makes this player a great deal .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Nomad II MG was probably one of my best buys (I actually received it as a gift) of 2000 . It had excellent sound quality and the docking station made transfer of MP3 files easy . The warranty period is too short and the company's policy regarding refurbished units make this a dangerous purchase .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The D-Link 100-32mb is a nice mp3 player for a lower price! superior to the DLink 90 superior to Dlink 90 . The sound quality is TERRIFIC. The player is great and cheaper than most . The DLink 100 is a great mp3 for a few bucks more .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Rave MP2300 MP3 player can hold 12 hours of music on one charge . Sound quality is very good and files download on to it very fast . The screen is easyer to read than the small Mp3 players made today . No FM tuner, volume can't go up loud at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This player is hideously outgunned for the price, as such it would not be possible to recommend it for anything other than a clearance price . While the sound is decent at best, and the extremely small size is a bonus, there are lots of negatives . Headphones are as expected useless and uncomfortable to boot .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is ideal for the front three channels in a home theater (splitting it into 10 feet x 3) The sound quality is also fine . A safe bet when it comes to moderate level cables .

{"text":" Monster XP Compact Precision Precision Stranded High Resolution Speaker Cable with Magnetic Flux Tube and LPE Dielectric 1ft U.S. Patent No. 4,734,544&#34;???  I recommend this to anyone with a hame theater or stereo system!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" A 500' roll of this cable for less than $100 is an absolute steal . It's not the ultra-thin copper tape, but it is pretty low profile, flexible, easy to separate, and easy to pin to the wall . The gauge is too small for use with mains, or a center, but for surrounds, it should be plenty sufficient .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" $160 surge protector protects a new Samsung DLP, home theater and new h20 directv hdr . It has performed flawlessly for the 2-months I have had it . It requires a 3-prong outlet with true grounding to operate . Bright color-led lights on the front of the unit are always-on .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" USB ThumbDrives are solid state, fast, and dont corrupt as easily if at all . Go the CD-R or CD-RW route, or even better, use something solid-state, but don't buy this product . This is still the most convenient way to back up files used on a pc .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These connectors are great! They fit my Monster M series cable to a T! All I had to do was take them carefully out of the package and gently screw them on the M series tipps . Connect the cable run to my Onkyo TX-sr707 and speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster makes you jump through hoops to do the simplest job . Connecting up speaker wire to these was harder than expected . You either need a specialty crimper or some heavy-duty pliers to get the job done right . These plugs are for 16 gauge stranded wire or larger and solid wire connections .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SS8RF was purchased to increase number of set-top boxes in a residential FIOS video coax install . The splitter was easy to install and the cable signal did not weaken . The labeling of the ports on the splitter suggests it is NOT bi-directional (1 input; 8 outputs)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fine quality product, good price, just may not do everything . Fairly easy to hook up to speaker wires . Allows one amp to drive up to 4 sets of stereo speakers without blowing the amp . Provides very good sound quality to all speakers . There is a marked volume drop across all speakers as each pair is brought on-line .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The problem with my amp shutting down from my old speaker splitter due to impedance loss has been completely resolved with the Monster SS-6 multiple speaker selector . This is a great product and the sound quality remains very good as well as well . It works great and was a good buy!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster, buy once and never need to replace it, until you die . Buy one and never replace it . Buy once and don't buy the same quality in other brand cables at cheaper price but you will be gambling your money trying to find same quality cable for few bucks less . Buy a new mirage sub, there top of the line prestege s-10 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The NS-U50 speakers are a must for this system and can be found for $30 a pair . Yamaha's website does not mention XP, it does work under XP . The only shortcoming is the software . The system works under XP, but the only shortcomings are the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" HipZip 31311 is a nice solid gadget for audio listening and digital file storage . Rechargeable battery life is remarkably good compared to the Rio 800 .

{"text":" The YEPP player is a fun gizmo to have and to carry around with you when you want a small MP3 player . It's downfall is that the thing eats batteries like I eat my cereal - one set a day . With an expansion card, this thing can carry about a CD on it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The outer appearance is very sexy, somewhat resembling a pager . Sound quality is excellent . It is crisp and clear, and the bass boost is significantly better than any other mp3 players I've tried . It takes less than 2 minutes to transfer 32MB mp3 songs to the onborad memory .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" There is clear distortion in mid-range sound, bass capability is fair at best . Static can be a problem even within 15 feet of the base when the headphones are at certain orientations . The product is not good for office use - as it let's out a lot of sound through these 'sound vent' kind of thing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The radio reception is dodgy, at best, slips repeatedly and is not loud enough to be heard over the sound of the shower . The clock is broken and resets itself everytime I try to turn the mirror lights on . The mirror is not fogless, and, worst of all, TURNED BRIGHT BLUE within the first week of use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are no $250 headphones; in fact, they're not even $50 headphones . Bass notes come out as clear tones, not indistinct rumbling or vibrating plastic . The sound from these headphones is excellent most of the way up the range -- it just falls apart near the top .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The player skips often and the life of the batteries is short . Buy it if you're short on money, not if you think Casio is trying to become the biggest electronics company by reducing prices . Don't let the price of this thing fool you, just because it is not expensive does not mean it sucks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The disks are great and meet my needs for handy long term storage of embroidery designs for my machine . They kept peeling off on their own . The labels didn't stick well, but the labels are good enough to stick well . The disks were hard to find at local stores .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Solo has changed a little, but it still offers accurate detection of photo-radar units . X bands will pick up false alerts from security alarms, but I'd rather have a few false alarms than miss the one time Smokey has his gun trained on my car . The unit is easy to mount and detach, too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave type walkman that ran and lasted years . The controls take a little time to learn but, a small price to pay . The earpiece feels uncomfortable at first, but you adjust to it and won't notice later . The single battery requirement is nice, too, too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sony MDP-EX70 headphones have the tendency to fall out of your ear when moving around . The sound is unbelievable asndf the fit just depends on your ear . The earphones can be a little difficult to get to stay in place . Consider the Sony headphones instead .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The S.N.MDR-E828 has a brighter sound with slightly higher bass output and high treble . Sound quality is a matter of personal choice, so you decide who wins . The value you get is great for 7.99 (which I paid for them back then)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cords are two different lengths, the jack has a gold tip, not like is pictured on the Amazon listing, which then came from TigerDirect . They were not in a package, no guarantee, etc.  BEWARE FAKES!!!!! The headphones which come with iPod or Sansa are better than this .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RS30 is the bottom of the Sennheiser wireless headphone line . The volume, tune and on\/off on the headphone are too small and just too awkward to adjust . Sound quality is not any better than standard cheap wired headphones that come with MP3, portable CD or MD players .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex MD3025 is a decent CD player . Sound quality is good, although headphones are included . It doesn't have any kind of buffer or shock protection, so if you nudge it a little too hard it will skip . It comes with an AC adapter or you can use 2AA batteries (not included)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell LB-1B Lightbeat Headphones are a must have . The sound quality is perfect and the flashing lights are awesome . The lights blink at the same pace no matter what you are listening to and they look cheesy . My biggest problem is the fact that the product states that the lights blink to the beat of the music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The coiling can be a little annoying, but for $10, who am I to complain?  It even comes with several adapters, including an airline adapter . The extension cord comes in handy when I'm at work, because I can move around without stopping my stereo .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex is no longer shipping these with the plastic file boxes . The plastic file box that's shown and described is now being replaced with a cardboard box .

{"text":" The only thing I don't love is that the head of the 1\/8\/\" connection doesn't fit through my iPhone case so I have to take off my case when inserting the connection .

{"text":" This is simply the best wrist rest you'll ever use . The underside of the wrist rest smells strongly of chemicals, but if you don't pick it off the table, you can't smell it .

{"text":" The head cleaner for my 8MM video camera works great!! I was able to convert over 50 tapes to DVDs and this was a money saver .

{"text":" These are made in the same factory (CMC Taiwan) using the same process as the Kingston CD's .

My car stereo has a hard time playing music burned to these discs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The power strip is well constructed and looks very nice if used in an area where it can't be kept concealed .

{"text":" Koss QZ-5 headphones do a great job of blocking out a lot of sound and offer decent comfort at the same time . The noise of the mower was not eliminated, but it was reduced significantly .

{"text":" This is the second replacement battery I've purchased for my SmartUps SC 420 .

{"text":" The $40 device is poorly made, buttons are difficult to push and recording quality is poor . It doesn't even work as a standard microphone for the computer .

{"text":" KBGear JAMP3 Player is a total waste of money, Don't buy it! It's cheap, tough, expandable, and despite a slight hiss the sound quality is very good .

{"text":" The cover is barely that wobbly .

Volume control not functioning . It has 2 levels of bass which are quite honestly moderate nothing special .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is awesome, deep bass and everything . It's like having two Cambridge Soundworks speakers on your ears, only the headphones are much lighter . Plus, they don't mess up your hair when you wear them . The only downside is that they begin to come apart after a while .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The interface is so simple that a child can figure it out . The battery level LED tells you that the battery is dead when you still have power .

The only thing wrong with it is that it tells you when the battery level is dead .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AT&amp;T 210 is an excellent choice for a corded phone . The lighted keypad is also a plus . It is powered through the phone line, so you do not need a outlet .

{"text":" Very comfortable and good sound for watching movies and tv on a device . The sound quality is a bit lacking for music though - so I docked one star . The cord is much too long for exercise purposes . The headphones are very uncomfortable and the headband is for a super big head .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product was perfect for me, at a very nice price . This strip had sufficient plugs; it is sturdily built (I did not want a long cord); and, the price was right .

{"text":" The outer barrel will flex with heavy finger pressure (and I don't think it's because I'm stronger than I think) Not recommended for anything precision or testing . Good for some uses, but it is cheap construction . The mail connector came loose from the tee . The screen appearance did not appear to be effected .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It is heavy, stays put so I can switch with my foot and helps manage power . It is just what I needed for my outlet and I am sure it will keep things from getting zapped . It looks OK, but it's made in China,  I really hope it works and is safe .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" This is the slimmest and most lightweight case I have ever seen . It is less than half as deep as a traditional CD case .

They are flexible and hold Blu-rays .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Tripp Lite SMART1000LCD 1000VA 500W UPS Back Up is not a good idea to add surge protection downstream of the UPS . Orientation of the plugs is wrong, so many people will buy this device to plug in a lot of wall wart power units .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" TDK branded CDR's are made by Ritek.  Don't be fooled, go try out another brand . These TDK's are not reliable because they are manufactured at a factory not known for high quality CDR\u2019s . Choose a different manufacturer!","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The 15' cord is essential in my old (1871) house with very few outlets . Gives us lots of room to plug in various peripherals and looks great .

{"text":" Trip-Lites surge protectors saved almost $10,000 worth of equipment from frying . The product is made in the U.S. and comes with outlet covers for dust and dust . The surge protector can take a powerful spike in electricity and keep whatever you have plugged into it safe .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The disk came already formatted. All of the disk was recognized  by the computer with now defected indicated . This was a very good price and I'd recommend them to anyone . Intend to reorder again. I'm sure glad that this seller still has them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is not as good as other microphones, but for the price, it can't be beat . This microphone simply doesn't work . It is useless to place on a desk and record a meeting, as I had intended . Maybe it would work better with a different writer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Tripp Lites are more expensive then some, they are way cheaper than replacing just one computer monitor, TV, Blu-ray player, etc. These days everything is electronic, toasters, washers - even your light bulbs - so you need good quality surge protectors throughout the house .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Surge Outlet Bar works great, is heavy duty with it's all metal construction, has a long enough cord for my needs, and I can feel comfortable using it and knowing it will help keep my appliances safe . Unfortunately no longer made in USA . Can't think of anything I dislike about this unit .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Tripp Lite LC1200 1200W Line Conditioner w\/ Isobar Protection 4 outlets 120V . The EMI\/RFI filters cleans-up electrical power, cable and telephone signals for clean cable TV and DSL internet transmission . The isobars are built like tanks in a metal enclosure, worth the money as a plastic enclosure might be a fire hazard .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" An electrical engineer friend of my Dad's suggested the Tripp Lite Isobar and I found them on Amazon . An extended on\/off switch made it convenient to tuck the sockets away under furniture, extend the switch to an accessible location, very convenient . The sucker is bulletproof .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Heavy metal IsotelUltra Tripp Lite surge protectors are very heavy and built like Sherman tanks . The one plugged into the plastic model spontaneously rebooted itself . The other day a sudden thundersorm came up out of nowhere and a bolt of lightning stuck, perhaps a half-mile away .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This surge protector has two groups of outlets . The first group has basic surge protection and the second group has surge protection plus noise filtering . The back has six more of these outlets, plus four outlets with the additional noise filter . It has been protecting my server for about a month now with no issues .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer wanted a control center to put everything in one place to shutoff . Product is well built with a solid shell and a long 10 ft cord to reach most outlets . It has plenty of &#34;Joules protection for most if not all computers and other accessories .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Tripp-Lite LC1200 wide-range AVR protects electronics when plugged in in remote area of Mexico . No issues with the LC1200 and works as advertised . It has a plastic hardshell case, not metal, but remains fairly cool . There is no appreciable magnetic shielding .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Good and well built power strip\/surge suppressor . Plenty of room for plugs and transformers . Easy to attach to a wall placement and easy to use side-facing outlets . Good and reliable, does not strike you as a cheap piece of junk, Tripplite is reasonable to deal with .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The CD-R media provides the best audio quality of any CDR media I've heard to date . The reflective coating is so thin you can see through it . The media can keep up with the latest 20x burning speeds and the audio quality is something you must have .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Out of the 12 I have used so far, had to trash 6 of them . Only 1 coaster ever and thats because I was running 3d studio max . The order arrived on time and was in good condition . The only problem is that they are so inexpensive you have to order a bunch to get free shipping .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Most people complain of only getting 120W through a cig lighter . All you need to do is find the same fuse that is in the inverter and stick in in the fuse slot in your car . Many vehicles have 2 or 3 spare fuse circuits available for add-on electrical accessories .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Isobar is encased in metal and has railings on the bottom for mounting . This new design is not really conducive to wood floors as it can scratch them . It is also not conducive to being carried in a computer bag, since the edges of the mount railings are sharp .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only thing I'm not crazy about is that plastic cover over the switch.. Kinda chincy but that's the only complaint . The plugs do not have a good fit and don't create a good contact .  The cover for the power switch feels very flimsy, thus the 1-star reduction .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Package had very little protection for items inside such a large box.,.,.,, needed much more protection than received . Only gripe with product is the ac plug is angled rather than straight . Amazon allows you to compare prices and get the best buy from Tripp Lite Isobar .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Isobar provides internal filtering for each device in the circuit, isolates it from all the other devices . It works very well, but didn't get the hum out of my amplifier like I had hoped . The LEDs on this unit are relatively dim but bright enough to read the status in direct sunlight .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The box does click a bit when it kicks in but it's not too loud and you do get used to it . Cheap insurance to protect expensive electronics that are frequently killed by power fluctuations and spikes . With summer coming up and thunderstorms looming, I would recommend this product to protect your expensive electronics .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The LCR-2400 is one of the few electronic devices that I've encountered that actually has wiring (12 gauge) that matches its advertised capacity . The unit omits an slightly audible hum which is a bit disturbing given this product suppose to kill the power line noise!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" APC LE 1200 line conditioners are equally well made . Tripp Lite has the higher surge rating than the APC, and the higher capacity 1800\/2400 watts vs. 1200 watts . But you'll need a 20 amp outlet and plug to make full use of the 2400 watt model .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The KSC 35 has a thumping bass that would clobber even the most bloated headphones out there, including the Grado SR80 . Good: surprising bass response and suitable for active lifestyles . Bad: maybe a little dorky looking and may leak too much sound for cubicle use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KSC-5 Earbud Stereophones are of very poor design and quality . They do not fit on the ear properly enough to be comfortable and the sound is just horrendous . Using these headphones is comparable to listening to an AM radio and will make even the best sounding cd players sound terrible .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is crystal clear and surrounding noise is closed out by the design of these headphones . It might seem a bit heavy when wearing it, but that is something you get used to . The only thing I don't like is that the earpads are made of plastic and not leather .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Harman Kardon HK3370 is the best amp you can find in stores like Circuit City or Best Buy or even in Comp USA if you are lucky enough . This is a stereo receiver for music mostly, not a surround sound home theater piece of crap . I think it works good for movies too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Harman Kardon FL8380 CD Changer has never failed to play any CD-R or CD-RW disc I have tried . It doesn't sound as good as the $1000-plus players I've heard, but for the money, it delivers and-then-some . Van Halen HDCD reissues sound awesome as does Beck's &quot;Mutations&quot.; and the latest King Sunny Ade releases .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony outperforms Harman Kardon in features, functioning, and just about every area except looks . CD-R compatibility is becoming absolete . Do some research before you purchase this product . The CD's are compatible with most CD players . Sony outranks Harman in features and functioning .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The reception is good and the extra bass really makes a difference . It was easy to install, and perfect for listening to music while you fix dinner . For half the price you can get a small boom box or radio that will sound much better . The only function that works is the CD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Onkyo 5.1 Surround Reciever 19.99, 6 disc disc disc changer 15.00, Yamaha Powered center channel speaker 4.99 . JBL PB10 subwoofer produces good bass, as advertised: down to 30(27hz)hz .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says he has spent $350,000 on a PB12 subwoofer . Subwoofer is highly unreliable and produces almost no sound, while the cone is almost decibels . JBL subwoofers are \"garbage and \"garry\" and should not be bought by JBL again .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex 8505 is the best valued portable CD player on the market . MPD8505CP soured me on CD-based MP3 players, so I decided to go with the Nomad Jukebox instead . Getting the thing to turn on is a bit of a trial .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster Cable S-Video is easier to hook up and more common on TVs . Monster cables do not carry an audio signal, there for you will have to use the optical audio cable . If you have an older reciever that doesn't have an optical input, you won't have any sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster cables are much clearer and brighter with these monster cables than with the stock ones . Highly recommended if your dvd picture is not up to standards for their own products . Well worth the money to any respected gamer . If you don't have S-Video on your TV, save yourself the trouble .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The CD's start delaminating and skipping after a few months if used for music . The top isn't prelabled with a logo so there's no pre-labeling to show through your custom label . 50 percent of the CDs don't work . Only 2 of the 50 had errors on it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Overall quality of construction reminds me of a cheap $29 player . It would only play for about 20 minutes then it would stop unless I turned it on its side or upside down . After waiting 2 months for a replacement from Genica, I accepted a refund and am now shopping for a better unit . Genica has not responded to any of my two dozen emails to tech support .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Sharp MDSR60S has the best value for money on the MiniDisc player\/recorder market - HANDS DOWN!

{"text":" The sound quality is great but the strap that hangs off ypur ears begins to hurt after about 10-20 min.

{"text":" Maxell T-18 video tape is not 9 hours like it says on the box but a little less than 81\/2 hours!! The front of tape is damaged the part that protects the tape is broken on the one side and is falling off . The quality control is not catching broken tapes but not worth the cost to send back .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" These are some of the worst full size headphones I have ever heard . The earcups are enormous but they were too small to fit comfortably on my head . They're not the most comfortable heaphones around (a little bit stiff) The covering for the left speaker is starting to come off 15 minutes after I opened the box .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips foldable Philips headphones don't just look cool, they sound great and are comfortable too . Sound quality is decent, but I had problems with sweat on the earpads, also it sits rather firmly, so I couldn't wear it for longer than an hour at one time . The only possible down-side is the short cord, only approximately 4 feet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It works well, but when the music level is low you can hear a little bit of noise when you push the buttons too . Another fail is that you can't see the songs names and directories names, you can search songs or directories just by an index . All the other features work well .","product_category":"Electronics"}

Balance, definition and spacial separation are superb . Balance, . definition and . spacial\u00a0separation\u00a0are superb .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These pages are a compact way to store CDs and DVDs with archives of my work . Unlike pre-assembled CD cases, you can easily reorder your disc or add additional pages without always having to move your CDs . The only reason I don't give the product 5 stars is that it's a little hard to get the disks out .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The behind the neck design allows you to wear a hat while you run . The single cord seems custom designed for runners - especially if you run with your MP3 player attached to your waistband . The only improvement is to loosen the headpiece somehow...it's irritating on the long runs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The D-Link DMP-CD100 CD player can play 10 hours of music in a small package . The sound quality is great, the anti-shock protection isn't very good, and if you're listening to mp3 tracks, then you don't get this at all at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best feature of the SM200C was its user interface . The only draw back was its inability for play lists, but I got around this by burning my Cd's with my playlist already set up . The price is 233% of the American price .  The only drawback is the inability to add play lists .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex Music CDR's are the most error-resistant brand I have used in 7 years with the CD burner built into my Philips stereo . The word 'music' on the label has nothing to do with the thickness of the CD . The quality of the discs differs from brand to brand .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex CD-Rs hold up to 703 mb of space . Average CD can hold only 699.99 mb . About 1 in 5 discs fail after <BR>burning sucessfully . For the price, they rock! The quality of these blank CD's has been excellent .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers sound great!  The only problem is that my soundcard cannot push enough power to them! When turned all the way up, all I get is a normal listening level . The only thing I was disappointed with was the lack of longer speaker wires . The speakers are well build, in nice wooden cabinets .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Techno Yepp [ASIN B000059RAB] has 4 equalizer modes NORMAL - CLASSIC - JAZZ - ROCK and each of them can be topped with the Surround 3D sound effect by pressing the 3D button . The built-in microphone catches more than I expected .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Maxell CD-R Music CD's have worked flawlessly for over 10 years . They are $12.99 at the CVS store for a 10 pack . The sound is great . Not sure why the current price from sellers(4\/28\/15) is so high .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Rio Receiver can be found easily for under a hundred dollars right now . There are a number of open source free programs out there for it . The software driving the device has never been updated and is orphaned now that the product is discontinued . The display works well, but you do have to get pretty close to read it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is high and above most other mp3 players I've heard . Software for transfering files from your computer to the player was intuitive to use . The only thing I had to figure out was how to use the music match juke box with the player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Intel's Pocket Concert can play 128 GB of music . Reviewer says controls are a little tricky, but at least they keep the appearance of this badboy clean and neat . The only gripe I have is the length of the headphone cord that got caught on the equipment and sent the unit flying off my waist .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Rio Volt is a great unit for any other use, but runners should definitely stay away . SonicBLUE seems to be firmly committed to upgrading the device features on a regular basis . The gaps between tracks used to be significant, but they've shortened the delay between loading tracks to nearly nothing .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The black underside looks hot, makes them look more professional than those cheesy green and light blue color cdr's . The black coating protects the CD from sunlight and from the laser, it also makes them more scratch resistant . The only thing that is not good is that they do not come with any cases .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The DSP-500 is a stereo VoIP\/game\/dictation\/whatever headset . It has two large 40mm speakers that sound quite good . The headset itself is extremely comfortable and uses a standard two-part headband . The microphone unit is standard stuff, don't know its specs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips unit is an example of brilliant engineering within a very contrained budget . It's amazing what some really good engineering can make of $100 . The only thing I would complain is that engineers managed to put lights on CD control buttons but forgot about backlit LCD screen .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is not great, but pretty good given the small size . The on\/off switch mechanism is poorly designed . The player can't be turned on with the remote control . It takes six &quot;C&quot ; batteries not six . It plays mp3s only in the order the files are stored on disk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sound is OK for the small size of the unit and probably as good as the sound of significantly bigger boom boxes . Setting the time is very easy, but it is still easy to forget how to do it . The display is big and easy to read and my daughter does not mind that the light on the display is always on . My biggest complaints are no battery backup and no MP3 playback .","product_category":"Electronics"}

I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants to listen to a CD while jogging or running .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Some extra kooky features I still can't figure out but hey, it looks impressive . The color is pretty close to black, which for me is dandy . The included belt clip makes sure the player stays secure to my waist while I exercise . The only complaint I have is that the belt clip broke off the first hour it was being used .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips 301 can play for up to 15 hours on 4 AA batteries . Playtime is about 10 hours without ESP and 6 hours with ESP enabled . It doesn't show the track and album name, but that's not a bad trade off for the price . The randomization feature is well designed and the randomizer appears to be a true randomizer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Expanium MP3 player never skips and batteries last a long time . You can fit several hundred songs on 1 CD and have hours and hours of music for a reasonable price . It's reasonably priced, you can play it in your car or hook it up to your home stereo and it's convenient .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" EXP503 is thin (a little over an inch) and light, unlike most of the MP3 units I've looked at . Sound quality is average maybe slightly above, but I have heard better . Screen hard to read in poor light (excellent in the dark and bright light) and resume function doesn't work on CD's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The display is very large and easy to read, and it backlits automatically for a while after a botton is pressed . The menu system is unintuitive, and I could never imagine myself ever being able to fully use the unit without the manual . The battery life if left uncharged is not very long .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This antenna works like a charm, and it's an excellent value for the price . It brings in the local VHF and large UHF stations quite clearly . It comes with a coax to screw down adapter, so it should fit any TV right out of the box . I recommend this product, especially to college students who want TV without cable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The packaging on this remote controller claims that it works listed devices, including cable boxes, audio equipment, VCR's, etc. It has numerous feature buttons which would appear to allow  the control of all features . Despite claims, you wind up with a lot of useless buttons .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The learning function required two or three tries before it worked but it did learn most commands on the first try . The backlight is a nice feature, but the button to turn it on is hard to find in the dark . The clock resetting is a common problem with the RCU810 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Installation was very easy and I was tuning the web in a matter of minutes . The tuner functions are straight forward and the software is easy to use . The only problem is that it get noisy because it works like a cordless phone . The software setup was a bit confusing with the update screens showing up for Windows and Real Player without clear guidance as to how to proceed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the third National Panasonic CD I have owned and they all still work after these years . Panasonic dropped the ball on this big time when it came to this product . The player can be dropped from 2-3 feet on to a hard surface and not get damaged . It skips while jogging so much I now have it sitting on my desk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality and the anti skip feature are flawless and exceeded expectations . The player is lightweight and easy to carry in your hand while walking down the street . It does not skip at all and the batteries last for a long time . Changing settings requires removing the unit from your carrying case .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Only complaint I have is that it just does not get loud enough for me (only when I am mowing) I listen to Metallica and Megadeth and I like to listen to them extremely loud. I want to be able to hear every symbol being hit and every blistering note being played at all times . For a little...you are getting the best money can buy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Price of the CD player is $50 off, and the warrenty is 1 year . It sounds great! The inline control is a must and this one is very usable . It doesn't skip in my normal use (daily commute) It's lightweight, it's lightweight and reliable . The sensitivity and base response is what you pay for, but your ears are the guide .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only 'problem' I have had is that in Wisconsin winters the temperature gets below freezing often, which wrecks the LCD display . The LCD not working after freezing is normal for LCD displays and is not a fault of the player . The only time it skips is when I'm driving over gravel roads .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" It holds plenty of CDs, it easy to open, its easy to get my CDs out of it and the zippers work well . The wallet is not big enough for all my CD's, but I use it for my secondary collection . It's not exactly groundbreaking storage, but it works well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 100-DVD wallet is an excellent companion in the car, and it is the best i have found that holds 92 CDs . It is flimsy, difficult to zip up with the weight of the CDs . The wallet is a good investment to keep your movies\/cds in pristine condition .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The pockets are barely big enough for the disks; the quality is as flimsy as i've ever seen it! Good enough for junk CD\/DVDs but i'll keep looking for something better for valuable disks . It did come with a scratch on the leather, but nothing serious .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The nylon material used on the outside is so thin and flimsy that it leaves wrinkles outside . The material surrounding the zipper is also from the same flimsy nylon . The case looks cheap and is a lot flimsier than my old case . It is a great investment to tidy up your entertainment area .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The zipper on one of these things broke within a week . The Quick Lock system really doesn't lock the pages securely, and they're always coming loose . It really is a pain trying to reorganise CDs since you can't just add or remove one page at a time .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Compact case was exactly what I was looking for . Compact, made well and holds 32 CDs . Very specious for multiple cds. I never liked cases that felt as if they were crushing my disks, and this DOESN'T do that . Very happy with my choice and would recommend .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" This one has a heavy soft shell that has the look and feel of leather, and zips up around the outside edge to keep everything safe . This one also has a kind of retractable handle that you can't see in this picture, and the handle has a little screen embedded in it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The material where the zipper is located was not as pictured . There were only enough slots for 192 CDs . The left side of the zipper was fixed and not removable .

{"text":" The product is superbly designed but execution is extremely poor . The software is very buggy .

{"text":" Philips MC50 3-CD Changer Micro System was highly recommended by Consumer Reports and it lived up to all the hype . Sound quality is good, however, the CD-changers clang away which I found quite annoying . The incredible surround option is a nice feature that gives the impression of surround sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Philips MC-70 is the best sounding system for the money . Sound is great but what's the use if you're always bringing it in for repairs? The sound is not compromised for size . The display lights up with a soft glowing blue and the IS (Incredible Surround) sound feature .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Max Sound and Bass Boost stuff contributes substantially to the sound .

{"text":" This is a decent compact system for casual use . The time settings are at 10-minute intervals, but there is an abrupt jump from 30 to 60 minutes . Some options still need to be accessed on the front panel, such as CD-repeat . Even at low volume, it seems to pick up subtle aspects of the music very well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" MX966 is good for movie but not for music . If you can afford more, I would recommend to buy the Receiver and Speakers separately . With 5 satelite speakers of 100 watts each, I never need to go above #25 on the volume knob, which goes to 50 (My kids tell me I am hard of hearing)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 32MB player has very good sound quaility and it only costs around $90-$100 . The bad thing is that the player zaps your battery life . If you use this player constantly, you better had loads of extra cash . The only downside to the Mini-Yepp is that its real downside is its expanded memory .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" PZ-5000 has all basic feature I want to have for MP3 CD player and I especially like the cosmetic, silver cool style . It seems well built and reliable to me, but only time will tell . This is the best buy among all MP3 CDs player for this coming season .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit takes four (4) AA batteries and requires an 8volt DC adapter . It can store up to twelve hours of music on a CD in MP3 format . The 8 levels of folders are really nice, and I love the ease of use and the large LCD display .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The visual display is far too small . I'd like to be able to read the number of the CD and cut that's playing . For those with big music collections, the binder is not helpful . I would suggest just creating a simple Excel spreadsheet with columns for disc #, artist name & CD name .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The most powerful shelf system you could buy for many, many years, only recently being overshadowed by new technology . It's spectacular for movie watching, gaming, and turning your room into a self-contained bass-pumping night club . The CD player is shot to hell but everything else about this system is still top notch 13 years later .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Compact and Stylish, this mini-system produces a quality of sound above and beyond that of any competitor its' size . The body itself holds one CD, through a glass cover that slides back and forth before rising up to allow access . Easy to convert into a home theater system, and loud enough to fill a 2000 square foot house .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Full featured (DTS, DD 5.1; AM\/FM Tuner; plays CDs, CDRs, CDRWs and VCDs and DVDs . Small footprint from each system part . Clever design with display\/RC sensor separated from the DVD player and the power amp inside the subwoofer . Image is even better than with my previous DV 414; sound is rich, crisp, very detailed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Pioneer NS-33 LifePlus Executive Microsystem with 30-Watt Subwoofer sounds great at any volume level . Remote and menu systems are a little tough to use, but again for this price, this is a great simple CD player . The sound does get distorted at high volumes, but if you keep at low to mid listening volumes the sound is fine .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SkipDoctor works fairly well but is more trouble than it's worth . The biggest problem with the SkipDoctor is that it takes quite a while to rotate the disc through the polishing process . Some CDs are simply too far gone, but the majority of discs can be repaired to a readable state .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers are just 30W and are not all that powerful enough to deliver through out the hall though the clarity of the sound is great . DTS support is a bit confusing because some advertising I read says it supports DTS however in the manual it states it doesn't .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This system has excellent sound and features - loses one star for noisy CD changer . If you have a CD writer you can make 5 compilation CDs of your favourite tunes and play them on random for all 5 disks . The operating Instructions are impressively lucid and there's a nice mix of bold-face and boxed type to call attention to the important stuff .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality on these earbuds is more than satisfactory, but they are difficult to seat properly on the ear . Metal of the speakers rub against the sensitive skin of the inside of your ear, resulting in discomfort . The metal of the speaker rubs against sensitive skin . The headphones are lightweight, inexpensive and perfect for people who workout .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a toy recommended for ages 12 and higher and should be kept away from small children . This every day toy is a great one for a genuine singer . It's easy to hook up to a big screen TV, but also great as a stand alone (that's how I practice)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound was not crisp and there was no great bass too . The bright yellow plastic makes it obvious that you can't hear the outside world . Audio has good bass, clean mid- and upper-ranges . The design is comfortable and holds up well to sweat - perfect for workouts .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only complaint I have with the remote is that it is not really a lighted remote . The only keys that light are the ones at the top indicating which piece is being controlled lights . The Macro function will turn everything on & off with one button . The instructions imply that the remote will learn non-listed brands as well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The MDR-NC5 headphones deliver excellent sound when plugged into the iPod . They fold up to the size of your hand and the AAA battery last for 6 coast to coast flights . With noise-cancelling on, the headphones managed to block out about 50% of airplane noise .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" STR-DE975 is a great example of planned obsolescence: a receiver with fantastically deep, crisp, and loud sound that failed after only a few years of use . The included learning remote allowed me to consolidate my 6 other remotes into one, albeit large . Sony products offer much more settings for the money .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It takes quite a while to load and label all of your CDs (it has no ps2 input for a keyboard) It will skip if you have the bass turned up and the volume too loud . The player is extremely easy to use and has quite a few features that are great if you entertain .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ability to organize discs by title and artist is excellent . Initial set-up is easy--getting all of your disc information input is difficult is hard, but worth it . The only reason to buy the 400 is if you connect it in series with the 450, or if it is used purely for background music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Initial set-up is easy--getting all of your disc information input is difficult is hard, but worth it . The only reason to buy the 400 is if you connect it in series with the 450 . The 450 comes with a remote control that features an LCD screen on which you can see all of the information about the discs in your player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony SAVAD900 Home Theater System by Sony, which I believe is their top of the line DVD\/CD surround system . The most impressive thing is the ability to decode DTS right in the system . It is so loud it is banned to the garage where i Rock day and night .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sub comes with additional features that other subs in its price range don't have . Sound is deep and very rich . Sub is not the prettiest sub in the world - not exactly a dog, but certainly lacking some svelte . Subs are an excellent addition to any home theater speaker system .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The remote is really great and has a long range range . The player skips on many of our cds which didn't skip in the old CD player . Sony has dropped a lot from previous esteem. The player did not even light up, much less play the CDs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony really was out to lunch when they designed a lot of the features . The sound is great for the size, but there are preprogrammed EQ settings that cover just about everything . This looks to be a scaled down version of the Sony MHC-MG110, which I have .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Noise Cancelling earphones have tiny microphones built into them that listen to outside noise around you . The effect is that outside noise is muted while the actual music you are listening to is not . The circuitry in the microphones attempts to get an approximate measure for the outside noise frequencies and then the earphone generates the approximate OPPOSITE frequency signal for your ear .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" EH2270 headphones have excellent sound quality and clarity . EH2200 series headphone is cheaper, and a far better value since the two are so very similar . The sound gets better with age and the earcups hug the ears so well that you cant hear any outside noise and your music wont disturb people around .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Creative Labs MP3 player is great. It can record up to 48Khz and play music at up to 44Khz . It requires high-capacity rechargeable batteries and sucks out energy very fast . The screen is very easy to understand and great for organizing music . It has only USB1 port .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Battery issues aside, the performance of the Nomad Jukebox is decent . Sound quality is good, and the filing system is a passable method for finding the song you want . If the charge drops below 65%, you won't have enough power to save playlists or settings .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Nomad IIc is light weight, it's durable, dependable, easy to operate and the quality of the sound is wonderful . 128MB SmartMedia cards are supported, but you will probably need to upgrade your player's firmware to version 1.05 . It's a great product from a great company, you will not be disappointed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The device was easy to set up and use, but beware of a few caveats . The sound quality is satisfactory for voice-grade audio, but it is only so-so for music . In my basement, in my suburban home, this unit cannot get a clear signal from ten feet away due to unknown interference .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The wallet does not have a handle on the spine . The binder rings are thin plastic, too big and look bad . All together I am not sure this wallet will last long . It's made pretty well and is perfect for storing my video games . It would be great if the sellers of this product would use a picture of the actual product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Only two out of the ten discs in the pack even worked straight from the box . The other 8 lack the necessary absorption properties to send them on their way to being coasters . The only good thing about them is the slim jewel case... should be a class action suit .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The surface is a little too slippery, making writing on it with a sharpie not as good as others . Finalizing the disc usually produces a 'Recording Error' although they do work . Some discs would not register on the recorder(no disc) This is the first brand of about 4 I've had the problem with.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The CD makes an unusually loud hiss, especially evident at low volume levels . The FM reception is also very poor -- it only gets a handful of stations with any clarity . The QSound signal processing (some type of phase shift) works fine for some songs but tends to accentuate certain instruments .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The XS-G3 is definately the best system in its price range . For you audiophiles, this thing has very low THD, only .08% . Others in this price range are mostly around 10% . The user interface is so-so and the remote is nothing to write home about .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the toughest CD player I've ever seen . If you drop it, it won't skip . It's waterproof, go ahead and spill anything on it; It's also sandproof, I haven't gotten any sand in the player in 2 months . The sound quality of this is far from the best I have heard .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is great, the headphones are good, and it has not skipped once, and the 30 radio presets is really neat . The provided headphones are TERRIBLE they hurt after use . The price and the flimisiness of the latches are the only downer's of the unit .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KOSS HR 110Y earphone radio has superior sound quality . The reception is very good, as well as the reception as well . Unfortunately, because my wife bought them two months before my birthday they AREN'T covered by the 90 DAY (who would believe that) warrantyY!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound is great and response is great . The base plugs in to the headphones and will recharge ni-cad batteries . The only slight negative is that it feels a little bulky, but once you start using it regularly, you can't feel it much . The headstrap is a common point of breakage .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The DUO-64 was the perfect solution to my 1-hour commute . The Audible service lets me download books and use my drive time wisely . The rewind feature when used on books only allows 2X rewind . It won't rewind faster or skip to the beginning of a chapter .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Duo-Aria can play MP3 MP3s from any cassette deck . Easy to get lost in the large amount of megabytes . The engineering is SHODDY and unfortunately, it's not even predictable . Sometimes digisette kills my other USB devices (mouse) and sometimes it doesn't work .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Koss CDP3000 is worth what you pay for it . The sound is very great, it has a Bass Boost switch . The anti-skip function is pretty good, but not perfect . It takes some time to spin up the CD and read the structure (somewhere between 10 and 40 seconds, depending on CD) sometimes it gets stuck during this process .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The power adaptor works with all riovolts (4.5 volt DC) The cassette adapter's sound quality is much better than the one I tried from Radio Shack . The power adapter did not work with either my Sony or Panasonic portables, so be advised!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It's not too expensive but then again it's very heavy and large and not well designed . It has 5 30W satellite speakers and a 50W subwoofer . Has AM\/FM receiver along with digital & analog inputs & outputs for satellite receivers, computers and computers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" MC-1 does a good job of ripping and associating the album cover with the CD . The remote is fantastic compared to the small, cluttered Audiotron remote . Ripped CD's will play when LAN or Computers are down . The user interface is not very intuitive .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The JVC XL-SV22BK Single-Tray Karaoke Player is a AAA++. It works beautifully. Good condition with a few scratches . The machine is by far the best value I found. It's not the top of the line but does everything that I need for home entertainment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These speakers are as good as my BOSE outdoor speakers at less than half the price . The sound is rich and clear with no distortion typical of outdoor speakers . The speakers come up when you browse for wireless speakers . We bought them thinking they were wireless and they were not . The info regarding these needs to be much clearer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Advent Advent AR570s are still going strong and sound great . Each speaker weighs in at about 10 lbs which would normally be a respectable weight until you figure in that they have built=in amps . Independent bass and treble controls are a great feature . The power cords don't seat well and tend to pull out too easily .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The audio on the talking book cassette player is hard to hear by itself in the car . The only negative I have related to this product would be: I wish the cord on the Jensen was longer, only because my son likes to have the player in the back seat with him .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price of this set is a good compromise for those who don't want to shell out four times as much for Monster cable . These cables are worth every penny they sell for @Amazon - way way way cheaper than some of the local retailer's which is sad - we don't have any ma & pa shops - do they even exist anymore?","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Rio Volt is supposed to have some new stuff out around Christmas . The buttons are easy to use and memorize if vision or light is a problem . The biggest problems with the Mp3 players seems to be skipping . This is the way to go until the major players start building MP3 reading portable CD's .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality was adequate for my needs . I like the limit switch which prevents you from jacking up the sound to levels that damage hearing . The extra $10 was worth it and I guess pays for the headphones . The cassette player works just as great as the other one only many times more expensive .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa boombox is small enough to fit on a nightstand, but plays beautiful music with easy setup . The speakers are tiny, tinny and not very pleasing at all . The small size doesn't compensate for lousy radio reception and mediocre sound quality . The basic model from Philips offers the same price as the basic model .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Headband looks like it should sit flat on your head, but it doesn't . Headband digs into your scalp like a slow medieval torture . Left ear piece crackles and makes a high pitched ringing sound . Audio quality is slightly improved, but after months of heavy use, noise cancellation became just annoying .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa Aiwa CD player has no anti-shock for MP3 CDs . Batteries are enough to play like 4-6 audio CDs . It plays all burned cds with no problems, unlike my 'Bose Home Theater System' and 'Sanyo Home Theater'","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This radio is perfect in it's simplicity . It has a unique Jetson-y vibe and takes up only a couple square inches of nightstand real estate . It's battery-operated, which I am neutral about, but it's nice not to worry about wires .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SL-SX289V portable CD player is the poorest machinery I've ever experienced using using . It plays all my home-recorded CD's with no problem, and the best part about it is that almost no matter how much you test its Anti-Skip System, it will never skip . The only drawback is that there is not an AC Adapter available as of this time... they are on backorder with the company until January .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" ICFCD830 CD Stereo alarm has a snooze button and a CD alarm setting . The display can be hard to read sometime and the backlighting cannot be adjusted . The sound quality of the CD player is good and the radio reception is good also..and it is small and compact enough for about any bedside night stand .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony Portable Sports AM\/FM Cassette Player is durable, has a great sound, but a couple of quirks . The volume knob is at the opposite end from the headphone jack . It is not auto-reverse, so I spend a fair amount of time taking off my belt and flipping tapes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" CD Projects (Targus) steel cases for computer games, applications and burned CD's . Durable case is great for off road traveling and frequent road trips . Detachable sleeves are a nice feature, but once again, the lack of space makes the sleeves virtually impossible to reattach .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" CD Projects pioneered the use of special materials in their sleeves which help protect discs . New sleeves are still better than many offered by the competition, but they're harder to use and less protective . Unikeep binders take up far less room on my shelf than a stack of cases would .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The power supply died after less than two years of mild use . The sound is very good, especially when listening to Dolby Digital and DTS encoded DVDs . Pro Logic is great, as well, but 2-channel sound is lacking . The optical and digital inputs come handy when playing PlayStation2 games and watching a DVD on the computer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa HT-D580 has Dolby Digital and DTS decoders and Pro Logic . The subwoofer sounds great, but it is powered with little distorion even at high volume . It doesn't come supplied with an optical cable and my dvd player doesn't have a coaxial digital output .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Componet Cables work Great! My PS2 look so much better on my 40 inch HD TV . The only downside is it makes the pixels in the game more obvious, but I'll take clear over muddy images . The same cable can be used for PS3 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa XP-R220 is a great product for the price . Sound is fine and it has nice features but the problems overshadow the positives . The player will skip easily unless set to anti-skip, which in turn reduces quality of the sound the more protection you add . No MP3 playing ability .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Aiwa XP-SP920 is a great portable CD player . Hardly ever skips- never had mine skip . It doesn't skip if you run with the CD Player in your hand . The lock that keeps the CD player shut can open itself . If dropped, the dial can open the player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This player died on the 29th day of my 30 day return policy . The shockwave is a great investment. Don't waste your time or money on this CD player. Unless u want to burn a hole in your pocket. The player is one of the best sounding portable cds I have ever heard .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SRF-M35 has no mono switch, instead uses a blend-to-mono circuit . Sound quality was also very good, but of course very much a factor of the strength of signal . It sounds good on music, but is a little annoying on talk .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only drawback is that you can't blow the windows out of your house . Lots of flash in the design, but the system sounds like a cheap radio . The speakers are nice sounding where sometimes they can add a little bass anf give a small sorround sound to the room where you're playing music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only drawback is the subwoofer, but it could be a little better . The sound quality blew me away. It was magnificent and system is extremely loud without distortion . The receiver is also excellent with multiple s-video ports, digital coax, digital optical, as well was multiple RCA inputs with one set on the front .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sound quality is great, easy to use and construction quite ample for what it is . Some instructions are not very clear and some editing needs to take place of the manual . The manual is one of the poorest manuals I have ever seen! The unit is cheaply constructed and the manual is worse yet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a really good CD changer for the price it is no longer working . It skips all my CDs! It'll skip a few songs ahead or even a whole disk ahead! It also makes funny noises at times like the CD isn't spinning right or something! Not HAPPY!!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Backlit display for time, etc. is easy to read and not harsh on the eyes in a dark bedroom . CD player quit working after a few months . By placing the buttons on the face of the clock, you need two hands to use them, one to hold the clock from moving backwards .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 7600GR is an excellent product made in Japan . It takes time for me to get accustomed to the input buttons which have multiple functions depending on the current operational mode . The real drawback is that there is no AC adapter and due to a different connector size, I cannot use the adapter from the previous radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Buy this clock because it was cute and you could play cds in it, but that's about all it's good for . It has a dimmer switch on the back, but since the it's not the numbers that light up, but rather the screen, the screen is like a mini-floodlight .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The clock supposes to change the time automatically on day that daylights savings starts or ends, but it does not . The display is too bright (even at dimmest setting) and volume was hard to adjust . tuning in stations was difficult . The atomic clock never worked .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" No radio, nature sounds may be good, but sound horrible through the speaker in the unit . There is no indication that the alarm is set by glancing at the display . The warranty period is much too short for this and other similar products . The version that includes the CD player but no weather band is even worse .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Timex T276B has a 99-year calendar, which is an added bonus . With 3 AA batteries, the clock's alarm will still function without external power . The clock automatically makes adjustments for Daylight Savings Time . Unfortunately, the loops are very short and less soothing than I had hoped .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product is the worst quality of any home electronics I have ever purchased . The three separate alarms are great, the CD alarm is really nice, because you can wake to your fav music . The phone not being able to dial out at times is a legitimate complaint . If the phone stops working, first replace the battery that is used for powering the features on the handset .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Phone sounds great, has excellent reception and sound . Caller ID is clear and works everytime . Alarm works wonderful is about all I can say for it . Phone is one of the best phone and its the one my mom would like to have . My mom wants one by or before DEcemeber so I can give to her for Christmas .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RioVolt has a very fragile feel to the case, and even causes skips when pressing the Volume control buttons . The display shows ID3 tag data, or the proprietary FIF Navitrack info if you want . The control surface was stylish but a pain to use, especially for navigating menus .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The buttons do as someone mentioned, get confused-- it goes back a song instead of going forward . It does make noises while it plays but it's not too loud . The best thing about it is the headphones it comes with, you would think by the looks of them theyre the typical generic headphones, but they have really good bass .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The anti-skip function doesn't work at all . The price is a very good deal . The remote is handy in the car... it's not wireless, but it puts the volume and track controls in better reach for the car or when you've got the player in your backpack or jacket pocket .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Good points include the dual time dual mode alarms, lock out clock settings, nap alarms, and nap alarms . One problem with mine is that when the room's dark at night, the display turns itself off or all but off . The display can't be fixed when it's dark .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The alarm feature stopped working in less than a month . The CD player is very noisy and makes scraping noises . The alarm clock is not worth your hard earned money . The unit is well designed but is very disappointing from a quality standpoint . It makes me wonder about all RCA products now .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sound is very good for a portable...has punch and plenty of power for playing outside at picnic or bar-b-que . Remote control is easy to use, as is the buttons on the machine itself . Poor radio reception, even in large metropolitan area . MP3 tracking is fair to poor at best . Sound is the best I've had in a boombox .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA RP1667 is an FM\/AM receiver with digital tuning and 10 presets for each band . It includes a standard pair of low-end headphones and a removable belt clip . The only drawback is the inability of the radio to pick up the weaker FM stations in my area .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ear pieces are extremely delicate and not able to handle touch without the foam unattaching itself from the headphone . The headphones sound much nicer than the similar Sonys ... a bit cleaner bass and a much better high end . The only bad thing about 'em is they seem a bit fragile, but its acceptable for the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KSC-55 headphones have great sound and are loud enough to be considered a full stereo system . They're incredibly comfortable once you get used to them . The left ear broke as soon as I took it out of the package; the part that hooks onto your ear kept twisting\/falling off . It hurts my ears to listen to these, especially with higher notes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The gentle wake feature is nice: the alarm begins quietly, then gets more insistent . The alarm fails to go off occasionally for no explicable reason, and the CD player runs amok . Buy this if you need a digital clock or a simple CD player or simple CD players .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The speakers sound wasn't very good and for this price it is not worth the price,by any means . The volume knob has some static when increasing the volume or lowering the volume . It is heavy and won't sit well on your head . The price was right for a used item .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Fw-i1000 is a great addition to your computer den . The sound quality is great, but the only complaint is that most of my MP3's weren't properly named . The device has no Real Audio or Windows Media Player inside the device . If you'd like a Real Audio-based Internet Radio, check out the Bose Wave\/PC instead .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit does not read CD-RWs consistantly which makes it useless for many MP3 discs . The unit is attractive and having a 5 disc player is nice at times, but this unit is not worth the money . For a 100 dollars it's worth every penny .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reception within or near cities where most users will find themselves using it, is perfect . Only worth buying if you can get it well below MSRP, or better still, free . Reception is great, but the channel buttons occasionally get stuck and have to be pried out using a pen cap .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" OS WR 102 is a terrific radio, especially considering the price here on Amazon . It is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid-Mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and thunderstorms . Only drawback is it does not come with an AC adapter; however, its sister unit the WR103 does .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Analog inputs are very good from vinyl or cassette, but silence-sensing auto track indexing is very flaky . Ease of use (once you get through the instructions) Beautiful layout and excellent quality . Remote control features is also excellent . Saves getting up and down from from the chair for minor corrections .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 2-step mega bass is the best bass boost I have ever seen . It competes with my JVC powered subwoofers at home . It has a remote so when you are riding on your bycicle you don't have to stop your bike, get off, and then push in the song you like . It doesn't do MP3, but I don't care .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is far and away the thinnest player Sony makes, and the rival Panasonic model is roughly the same . It uses G-protection which gives you skip playback as long as you don't run . The sound is also very good and the small cylinder remote control is quite fun to use too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony DEJ621 is an excellent CD Walkman from an excellent company with a great set of features that are (mostly) easy to operate . With G-Protection switched on, there is some loss of quality, but this a small trade off at being able to listen to your Walkman whilst doing even the most vigorous of movement . The quality of the audio not only depends on the device, but also the headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound level is terrible and flucuates and sometimes even loses sound altogether . Treble is not too sharp, but there is sibilance . Bass is lacking, but that can be adjusted with some EQing . The one drawback is no volume control on the cord, which isn't a problem on my computer .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Terk TV-55 antenna is not worth the high price with this quality of reception . The higher up the antenna is better for HDTV than for other HDTV . Terk is supposed to be for U.HF-VHF, as it was able to pick up stations from 50 miles away .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" For the inexpensive price of [$$$], this Sony remote control works well . It is easy to hold and controls my Sony TV, Sony Amplifier\/receiver, Sony VCR, and Panasonic DVD player .

{"text":" The size was a bit bulky but it's better than 8 remotes . With daily light use the batteries last 6-8 months if alkaline's are used . With the high $ Energiser AA Lithium batteries they can last 1 1\/2 years without needed change .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" TDK's use of the word 'premium' is misleading marketing . The tapes are standard grade tapes . They record OK and the playback quality is as good as any VCR tapes but obviously not good as DVD . Amazon.com should take some responsibility for this .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Mechanical VHS-C Adapter costs $15 . The device devilered perfectly and smoothly every time I popped one of those old-time tapes in it and into the VCR . The only problem is that the mechanism is a little stiff to move so you need to apply a bit of force when you open or close the slide .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DSJ15 has solved my problem of listening to library books on CD while walking my dog .

Great shelving for CDs or DVDs, but you need to modify the bottom to make every shelf the same size to fit 4 shelves with DVDs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster batteries are good, just not the best, or best value . They charge fully in about 3 hours . They are not the highest powered batteries, the newer Kodak Max 1850 mAh ones are. They are also cheaper and more powerful than the newer ones are .","product_category":"Electronics"}

The service is pretty fast, but the product itself is not working . The signal of the other output is very weak .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the cheapest four way splitter I could find to suit my needs, and it works without problem . This is why I gave it 5 stars because of price and brand name . I don't see any reason not to go cheap unless you need a guaranteed frequency range greater than 900 .","product_category":"Electronics"}

Buy the media bridge cables .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Pre-amp preamps are hard to find as hard to get as rare as pure gold these days too . One channel of the pre-amp quit working once but it worked for a couple of days . Pre-amps are light and unobtrusive - once you get it connected you never need think of it again .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer: Installation instructions for this device were clear, however there was no AC adapter included to operate the device .

{"text":" Monster PowerCenter provides 2 plugs and an in\/out for coax cable making it perfect for a TV + TiVo\/Cable\/DVD\/Roku\/etc combination by itself that doesn't need a huge surge protector . The warranty only covers items directly connected so while a cheap power strip could be attached to this, only the power strip would be covered .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster discontinued the tool-less twist-crimp connectors . These are crimp on and do not work properly . After trying to crimp just two of them, they fell off the wire . The insulators were hit and miss as to how well they fit over the connectors .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer: Excellent thick wire, definitely improved my sound . I did not need any more than 20 feet and I was happy when I found this smaller batch . I would recommend to a friend. It strips easily and the installation can withstand quite a bit of punishment . Reviewer says it strips easily .","product_category":"Electronics"}

The sound travel clearly through the adaptor without any problems . The adaptor is a good adaptor for the traveling musician .","product_category":"Electronics"}

The website was easy to use. The gauge is small but it works great. The price is right .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The thin cable gauge (22?) made it challenging to use with the spring type speaker terminals on my stereo . The pictures could have been a little bigger to make it easier to see it, but it was great! The cable isn't worth returning so I'll probably just chop off the plugs and use the speaker wire .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Cables are normally between 3-5 dollars at most stores, even drug stores and hardware stores, so why amazon's RCA brand cords are more expensive . Used this to connect my Roku to my Sonos system . Works as described; now i can watch all my stuff in surround sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It doesn't do anything special, but then it wasn't designed to . It just goes along working reliably doing what it is supposed to do, which is what I bought it to do . Bought this adapter for DJing and it developed an internal short within a few weeks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" DAVS500 is excellent for a little room and for a DVD\/VCR system...that's all...if you want to play music you are wrong with this equipment .

{"text":" Sony's WEAR 'phones are much heavier than your average pair of in-ear 'buds . Spring-loaded earpieces are held together by a spring-loaded mechanism . Because the earphones are so heavy, they tend to drag your ears down, increasing the distance between the ear and the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The size, ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock . The system offers surrond sound from 2 speakers (where others need 3 to 4) , a subwoofer, plus reciever and dvd\/cd player . The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video .","product_category":"Electronics"}

The main playing buttons, as well as the play mode\/display\/play\/bass buttons are all arranged around the display near the display .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The receiver has no bass, treble, or equalizer settings that can be changed . It is a great receiver with lots of sound options including fiber optic input\/output nodes . The DTS and Dolby digital decoders sound very potent and clear . For the price, what you save in this piece, you will spend it in speakers to achieve good musical sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This brand is slightly better than the standard Sony\u00ae microcassettes I used to use in my recorder-player, but not by much . The sound quality is marginally superior, and theres a little less background noise to get in the way of whatever speeches, lectures, or verbalized thoughts youre taping for posterity .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The only thing that could be improved are the instructions to assemble as it has many options . Arrived as expected and too less than 20 minutes to assemble . The stand is very nice and if I had Bose speakers i would be pretty pleased with it . My Yamaha speakers did not fit and I had to use different screws .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The only change I'd make in the design is having it so that a call could be transferred from one handset to another without having to use the intercom feature . Sony SPP-A2780 system with all their additional handsets do not interfere with each other . Sony is the only phone that has actually worked for me .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The unit looks and feel of good quality . The extra space for large transformers on one side is nice . It also comes with a cat-5 and coax cable for protecting your ethernet and cable connections . The power cable was a bit long for my application, but thats actually a feature and not a reason to knock the product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The screen is slippery and smooth as silk . It seems to repel finger prints and dust and wipes clean very easy . A bit tricky to put on, but a little care goes a long way toward a perfect fit . The look of the screen is opaque and the clarity of the original screen is significantly compromised .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Excellent sound, love the inline volume control, works as advertised . Great for skiing as you can adjust the volume without pulling out your mp3 unit to the elements . They sound great as always from Sony and the volume can be lowered almost to completely quiet . I only wish they were a little longer but I can deal with it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" NEW: BOUGHT 2 PAIRS AND BOTH WERE VERY, VERY WEAK.  EAR CUP PADDING CAME OFF the first day, HASSLE TO PUT BACK ON AND WERE NEVER THE SAME. DID NOT FIT COMFORTBLY in EAR CANAL. MAY MAYBE MY CANALS JUST DIDN'T like the FEEL of PEANUTS in them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Koss KTX-6's twist-flat construction makes for a very low profile that's perfect for my needs . The sound quality, while not as good as the Porta Pros, is very decent .

It came pre-programmed to control my Direct TV receiver, and was easily programmed (about 3 minutes total) for the TV, VCR, and DVD .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AV700 was purchased for $50 at Circuit City . It protects TVs, Blu-Ray, PS3, Wii, HD cable box and other electronics .

It took a beating and saved my electronics years of life, but again, I would still recommend it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable plastic isn't as thick as one previously purchased so some ends\/cable heads do not fit as snug as I would like with extra crimping .

{"text":" The REB 1100 is the only REB that you can load third party content onto the device . The newer version the 1150 does not allow you to load third-party books .

{"text":" The design is excellent, the battery life is surprisingly long; if I could improve anything, I suppose I'd make the text a little sharper .

For those who like some of the older technology, these Sony CD players are great .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony's software converts all mp3 files into a proprietary code that makes using the player impossible .

This Jukebox not only plays songs but it maintains playlists, but also also also plays songs in different formats .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The battery life with the radio on is usually about 66 hours, and with the CD playback with ESPMAX on it's 24 hours . The AVLS(Automatic Volume Limiter System) works great too, although I don't use it . The headphones as usual are horrible but with proper ones the sound quality is great .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Onkyo TX-8211 receiver has a built in phono input . It has a sharp looking black finish which matches most of my other audio equipment . Out of the box experience was a little disappointing because the supplied cheapie FM antenna made the receiver seem like a dud with respect to picking up stations .","product_category":"Electronics"}

With an FM sensitivity of 11.2dBf, you'll be able to tune into your favorite radio stations easily . The only thing lacking is WiFi capability .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sherwood RX 4103 can be used to power patio speakers . It can certainly do more, but it was cheap alternative for simple power amplification .

{"text":" Sony PSLX250H turntable plays 33s and 45s, not 78s . Sound quality is good... not extremely good, but it sounds like you're listening to a record and not a player . The only thing I have done is swap out the stylus which lasted about 100 hours .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The display is way too dark when you are trying to tune in a station, but even more importantly the display letters are so flippin' small, you need a magnifying glass to see what it says .

{"text":" Jensen DSC-IR 100A Remote Control Extender is a simple, but very effective device to control your cable or satellite boxes without the need for multiple box purchases or lease . The problem with this device is the receiver is constantly receiving background noise and transmitting a constant stream of commands to the device .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic could have included a better cartridge for a little more money . I clean all records on Loricraft machine ($2,200) before they can go before playing .

{"text":" The only negative is the headphone out jack has no volume adjustment, so for me it is useless . Easy to operate, but sound quality is really just decent . Tape-to-tape record function did not work at all . The Operating Instructions are incredibly vague \/ amateurishly composed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This cable greatly enhances your system . It is especially good if you have SSX Tricky, the graphics are mind bogalling .

{"text":" The XGL-LW100 fiber optic audio cable will offer you the best sound performance from you Xbox (such as Dolby Digital and DTS, sound during game play) Without one of monster Cables your XGL will be useless .

{"text":" The headphones are good but a little pricey: if you need to buy one set of good headphones, look elsewhere .

It reduces external noise, but one should note carefully that 10dB is NOT all that much .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The D-Link Roq-it has a relatively large capacity for it's price and can function as an external hard drive .

{"text":" Monster Connectors are a great answer for my vintage audio system--Sansui 9090 Receiver & JBL L-100 speakers .

{"text":" Sanus quality is great, other than the broken corner, its quite impressive . For the price and easy I certainly couldn't do better . The base, post, and piece the speaker sits on are all very solid . The stand's finish was satisfactory and speaker wires can be hidden somewhat too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Assembly is easy, but the hardware that comes with these is kind of a joke . The bottom spikes have a very loose threading, so they don't stay very tight . Appearance is great although they could use some kind of mount in the back for stability but for the price these can't be beat .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sanus speaker stands were attractive, well designed, well made, easy to assemble, and sturdy; yet inexpensive . The wire covers were easy to install provided you first attach the base, then bend the covers into the slots at one end and slide them down toward the base . The box for the 36 speaker stands was mishandled in transit and the corners of both base plates were cracked or broken .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" This remote can NOT support a VCR and a DVD player at the same time . Easy to program. Up and running in 60 seconds. Big, clear numbers and easy easy to program . Be sure to pick up some AA batteries for it! It should say &quot;batteries not included .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The picture shown is for the previous version of the remote, which has the same product number but has a different shape and layout . It works with my devices, but my son with Autism cannot use this version, because of the placement of the buttons . When I previously commented the same as this review, the seller promised to revise the picture the next day .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" iPaq PA-2 is a reliable player if you use Windows Media Player . It then downloads in the wma format . MP3 format does not work . The sound is great, however it doesn't have the best selections on volume . Not recommended if you are in a hurry to download your music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" MP3 player is frustrating, but navigation is non-existant . DVD player features are same as you can find in any cheap player . Unit died after 9 months due to a short circuit in the audio amplifier . No warranty; no address or telephone number in packing materials .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a great entry level system for someone who wants true home theater . The receiver is exceptional and the DVD gives you a crisp, clean picture . The center channel and sub-woofer speakers are excellent and fill up any room with great sound . The user's manual was very hard to follow-pictures but no actual words .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Be careful dint over tighten the nut that holds the speaker!! It cracked!! The main driver is just 4\" (like the Heco), the bass port allows the bass to come through much better at lower volumes . The bass port is much better than the 4\" driver .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Subwoofer needed to be added to the ND310II speakers . The bottom hole requires a 3\/8-24 FINE thread hex head bolt, 1.25\" long (in the specialty bolt section) JBL N26AW II speakers have great sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" S38IIs are superb sounding speakers with sweet, clean highs, a natual-sounding midrange, and clean, full bass . They sound great with moderately-powered amps and receivers . Best speakers blew away the Bose 301 and other two way bookshelf speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The S312 II is a great speaker with clean, sweet highs, natural-sounding midrange and clean, deep bass . The build and construction is top notch and each speakers comes in at around 50lbs . The clarity and definition of the sound from these speakers is favorable over most anything .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The JBL S-Center delivers lower pitched material with a clarity that you won't find in most 2-way speakers . In DTS music, sometimes a lead vocalist's voice is sent directly to the center channel, and there is nothing like a human singing voice to test the range and natural-ness of a speaker .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JBL sub delivers that tight low which is the signature characteristic of JBL's studio reference models . It will bite you and literally shake your house with its 12-woofer which you need to have for the realistic low . For less than 300 dollars, I have to say it is a quite amazing offer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JBL DCR600II-Z 6 x 100-watt receiver powers all of the speakers, including the subwoofer . The remote is a little hard to get used to especially for a person with big hands . The sound is very good considering the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the second time I purchased Sony VHS cassettes from Life Deals in Brooklyn, NY, and they sent the same factory-sealed, high quality product . I highly recommend Sony (over other brands), and would buy them again . They have taped well and withstood many viewings... so far, with no troubles at all .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price of the Sony 8-hour tapes has skyrocketed since they have been replaced by DVDs . The quality of the video quality is pretty good considering they are VHS tapes . The company\/person who packed this item did a very poor job! No packing material was used and I had 1 tape that was broke to pieces!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These were inexpensive and work great . Video clarity is excellent as its digital . Good luck finding singles in a bricks-and-mortar establishment unless they specialize in the field . These are working just fine for us. We are well-pleased. Thank you for the service .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Cleaning with a Cleaning Cassette is quick, easy and the smart thing to do . Using different brand tapes (ie: Sony, Panasonic, JVC) will quickly clog mini dv heads . The material of one brand of tape attracts the material from a different brand .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sony disc cases are white, while the TDK are black . White enables writing, putting Sony one notch above TDK . I prefer the jewel cases because they are slim . They are, however, sometimes inconvenient to open, and pressure must be applied carefully so as not to break the plastic and drop the disc .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony 32X CD-R 50-Pack Spidle is simply amazing! They can record up to 700 Megabytes of computer information . They can safely and easily back up your computer or transport your data to any other computer that supports CD-Rs . About 1 out of 5 of these discs ended up in the garbage .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Rio Riot is an excellent player . The sound quality is great and I rip my CDs to WMA at just 96 kbps . The battery lasts 10 hours at least and it even took me about 5+ hours to intentionally deplete it with full volume music and backlight alway on!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" If you're looking to store a large sum of MP3s this player is for you . Sound quality is great, and I was able to fit my entire mp3 collection (admittedly not very big) on it . Battery life is good, on the down side the battery is internal and cannot be removed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Archos is the best MP3 player\/recorder on the market . It holds my whole CD collection and is very portable . It shows up as another hard drive on your desktop and you can drag and drop as you please . The design is kind of clunky and button design and feel could be improved upon .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Creative Lab's NOMAD JUKEBOX is the superior player on the market . The interface and software are SO (so, So, SO) easy to use . The sound is surprisingly good and once you discard the manual and do trial and error it actually is pretty easy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The HTS 2600 MKII is a good product for the price ($184 @ Amazon) Provides excellent power surge protection for my $6K investment . Provides plenty of power outlets, coaxial cable outlets to organize the spiderweb of cables for HDTV, X-Box, DVD, VCR, AV Reciever, Sat\/DVR with room to spare .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The angled spade connectors enable a secure connection, with more conductor to conductor contact than banana plugs . The brilliantly elegant feature accomodates a wide array of speaker cable types and guages . The spade disconnects from the black base, fan out the wire, and then screw the spade back on .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Not the best design or most handy due to only having two outlets, but this gets 5 stars from me for one simple thing: a let through voltage rating of less than 330V . This is exceptional and hard to come by these days especially at this price! I was so happy I ordered a second .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The jury is still out on the effectiveness of this power center, as it has not been put to the test . The unit's LED's do function properly, but the one negative is how snugly it secures onto a wall plate . If you cannot get your sub protected by your main surge protector this is an excellent alternative .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The hanging mechanism is very poor . It keeps falling off of the mount it comes with . The packaging was easier to get into than most devices of this type . The extra coax and phone cables that come with it were of no use in my case . Fortunately I found someone who wanted them so they were not wasted .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Monster's product offers some decent surge protection on both plugged in devices and on coax . The blue light emitted by the on button can serve as a night light . The labels are largely useless because they are somewhat obsolete (VCR, CD, CD) but they don't hurt .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" AVS2000 is not a life changing experience, but it does lighten your wallet several hundred dollars . It does stagger the power on sequence of your equipment to prevent startup current surges . It is overkill for 90+% of all MODERN equipment . A $10 voltmeter can tell you what your voltage is .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Each wire is color coded so you don't cross wires when hooking up components . Perfect for long runs between receiver and speakers . The two interlaced yarns ensure noise immunity of a thread to the other . Comes with all the cable jacket and jacket separately for each thread .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cables fit so tightly, we thought we may break the PS2 . Running your PS3 in component cleans up the picture, and being able to use the progressive scan makes it look even better . The cables to your tv and PS3 stay on them tight like a glove . They are not as easy to put on your come off .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is very good and it is very easy to install, both in-wall and out-wall . The wires are wrapped around a small plastic tube making them seem bigger so in reality you probably only have 18 AWG of wire . The difference in sound quality between this and 18 gauge .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" For $5 (shipped) I couldn't really ask for more. I used to run sound through a LG DVD HTIB I purchased some years ago . The sub crapped out on me about 2 years ago and I purchased the Pioneer VSX-1020-K .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The insulation is very thick so you should never have a short in the wire . The only problem is not many stores sell this wire . I'm not sure why you would buy there more expensive 16 gauge wire it costs double the price by the foot and looks not much different .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Package came with selection of hardware for connection to different speaker styles . Sturdy construction and strong enough for 6-8 lb speakers . Easy to install, easy to install and works great! Easy to adaptable for use on either walls or ceilings by using or removing an extra connection joint .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is great, and the remote control is a great feature . The functionality of the remote is not intuitive . There is no display on the CD player itself, so if you do not want to carry the remote, it can be cumbersome . The player skipped when I had it in my pocket while walking at a relaxed pace .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The case is fairly slim and has space to overstuff it a bit . It works perfectly with my Honda, its like it's not even there . My radio only takes CDs, so I've burned tons of them . I would recommend it to anyone with a large dvd\/cd collection for their car .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The pages are really easy to flip and there are extra spaces in the front cover for easy access . The front cover has an insert where you can store 16 Dvds\/cds and can be removed and becomes a very handy travel case . The folder is also very sturdy and has nice leather .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" For a light, easy MP3 player, this model is excellent . It comes with a 32 MB MMC card, and takes a max of 64 MB for about 50 for the memory card . The radio does nothing, i can only get AM stations, and MAYBY some FM if i have my hand at the headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" PM52S can control 5 devices and has learning capabilities so any equipment not supported can learn from your old remote . It is programmable which means, I'm able to access just about any Home Theater Receiver option, from Dolby option, audio input selection, even adjusting the speakers!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The headphones block out 95% of outside noise and block out about 95% outside noise . They have adjustable sizes and earpieces rotate to fit you better . The only drawback is that they are a bit tight on your ears, but this is because a sturdy design that looks like it would take a lot to accidentally break them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The laser pointer keychain is working satisfactorily . The toy is worth the ten dollars but the shipping SUCKS. The extra tips provide a light in a $, star, arrow, circle, and elongated beam . It is a fun item for older kids who will not shine it into people's eyes .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The buttons are larger than the newer remotes I have now for the flat screen TV and DVR but not large enough to maybe help a vision impaired person . The buttons were not big, like advertised, and it did not work . The picture is correct, just the part about the keys is off .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Buy this product if you don't like it return it with in 90 days with your receipt to your local Target store or the online center . It functions as designed. Good sound and visual quality . It works well in low light or bright light only thing is missing is color anyway .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable market is 99% hype to get you to pay hundreds of dollars for cables that are no better than $20 . Buy solid ones, but not ones with superfluous claims . Buy the GE same quality for much less money . G.E. in general is a respectable brand in their products .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA RCU 300 would not control two of my VCRs: Panasonic Omnivision VHS and Sharp VC-H942 . Reviewer: \"This is trash (unless you know in advance that  it will support your existing device)  It surly isn't upgradeable.  If I can't return it for free, it is best to just throw away\"","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA ANT1250 has no electronic features for it's operation . The reception is clear with very little ghosting on the channels once you set the dipoles . The only drawback is that every single time you go to a particular channel you have to fool with this antenna to get a clear picture .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA's 64MB Kazoo MP3 player is one of the best players I have found . It stores just the right amount of songs and doesn't suck up batteries . The sound from the supplied headphones is awesome . The only drawback is you need the MMC card to expand the memory .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Lyra is well built and the menus are well thought out . The backlight comes on automatically anytime you press a button . The headphones are light and comfortable (and I have a big head) The sound quality from the headphones was clear and crisp . The sound from them was crisp and clear .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Samsung YP-30SH (128MB) MP3 player is a great player, although the software is clunky and confusing . With one AAA battery for almost four hours of play time, the total size is that of two AA batteries lined up next to each other .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Nomad doesn't recognize a lot of my music (probably due to missing tags) so it files the songs under \"unknown\" The interface software works fine with win2k and is about as dummy-proof as possible . The sound quality is just fine, and I am rather picky on sounds .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The package came on time, and was nicely packaged, but there was no fuse in the box . The wires are 17 feet long, not 20 as stated in the product description . The wire is not a high quality wire for competition like set up, unless you use the stuff for speaker wire, then its cool .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The colors are nice, the see-through feature is helpful, they keep my DVDs and CDs clean and are great for mailing, also . They snap closed, stay closed and are fairly sturdy . They hold the disc securely, but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it . Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE!!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Autoscan mode lets you drive by shopping centers without having to change from highway to city . The detector is sensitive enough to pick up laser and other band signals off of other cars to give you more advanced notice . This detector has 360 degree Laser detection and 180 degrees detection for all other bands .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These cables are good and they cost less . The quality of the color was significantly worse than even a standard video cable . These carry the signal as well as Big Name Brand cables costing ten times as much . The color was messed up after about 6 months of using the cables . Save your money for buying more movies!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Whistler is a respected vendor in the radar detector market . This is a model that won a few awards when it was first introduced in 2002 . The low price is because it is being closed out, although you can still find it available online in the 60-100 dollar range . Be aware that this model does not detect the most up to date POP technology .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony CD Walkman has good sound through decent to very good headphones . Anti-skip feature does work, but still, has it's limits, of course . The one thing that has disappointed me is that it did not come with a standard pair of headphones . It has a reasonable tollerance for somewhat scratched CDs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" D-E350 has amazing sound, very very long battery life, never skips and looks great . It plays all my CD's, including CD-RW's, even badly scratched ones . The only trouble is that it won't play one of my cds to good . It will skip 4 time's during a song .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" For two hundred dollars, this is one of the better book shelf\/mini system out there . The sound is great, whether you're playing CD's, listening to the radio, or listening to MP3's . The design doesn't do anything for me; in fact I find it rather tacky .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only real weakness I think this thing has, is only one optical input . It's an extremely up-to-date receiver with Dolby Prologic II and Digital 6.1 . We use this receiver with our Blue-Ray player, Fios DVR,HDTV and Yamaha 5.1 Surround Speakers for a great home theatre .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Yamaha's HTR-5550 has a high current amplifier . The sound quality is outstanding, good definition, no signal clipping . Yamaha's DSP processors are second to none . The remote is logical, as is the receiver for the most part except for the radio presets, it's a little tedious to use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Yamaha receiver is a great mid-priced option for those who don't want to spend a fortune . Sound quality is clear and smooth, perfect for a mid-sized room . Dvd audio is incredible, especially using digital inputs and disks with decent Dolby 5.0 or dts .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Yamaha YHT-300 system is great for first time buyers or even as an upgrade to an older home theater system . The HTR-5540 AV Receiver delivers 75 watts of power to each of the 5 speakers . Front, Surround and Center speakers are average, do not be bothered by 75x5 watts .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic's warranty option is to ship it to Texas and get a 'refurbished' unit back, in ten days or so . Sound quality is good, better than most clock radios, stereo or mono, but not as good as a Bose, CSW or Kloss .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is exceptional regardless of what function you are using it for . The surround sound is adequate while the overall sound is quite good . Panasonic customer service was rude, on hold for 30 minutes before I just gave up . The drive motor is cheap and burns out quick . Just avoid the brand name .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SC-HT95 is the most well-balance package out there . Features include 5-disc changer, VCR, DTS, Proposive scan, VCD, CD CD and DTS speakers . It broke down exactly in 2 years . It was nice, but the rear speakers are really quiet .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is very good, and it never skips . The only thing missing is that its not water resistant . The volume is not a loud but just don't breath as hard . The controls are hard to locate sometimes because they are so small . The remote thing hanging off the headphones are more annoying than helpful .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is pretty good, although the headphones don't press snugly against your ear which doesn't allow you to hear alot of the bass . If you're looking for something durable, this is not the one . From an eagle eye view, it's just a tad bigger than a CD, but it gets a bit heafty .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is good but not very loud . Don't spend all your money on an expensive one, when this one works just as well . Stick to panasonic or sony for your dicman needs though . Great way to take CDs full of MP3s on the road .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Panasonic SC-AK600 has a 5-cd changer in the space of a 1-CD changer . The system has both Dobly Digital and Pro Logic decoders built in . It takes a little time for the cds to change and you really don't what CD is in what drawer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the BEST music player you can imagine for the money . It is a single CD and cassette player . It does not read MP3 disks as majority of new systems by Philips do; and also the speakers do not seem to be powerful enough . The speakers are tiny speakers, but do not underestimate their size .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The ESP system is WONDERFUL! even when riding around on a bumpy lawn mower, it never skips! AT ALL! The only bummer is that it doesn't have an AM\/FM radio, but I like the see-through design .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only thing the salvages this purchase is the AM\/FM tuner . Even with the skip protection turned off, to save battery life, it still skips very little . The volume is very low, even with the volume all the way up and still hear faintest street noise on cheap headphones that it comes with .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It plays mp3s with good sound quality and has great skip protection . The resume remembers for a long time but only on CDs . You can program a playlist but as soon as you open the cover (normally trying to adjust the volume) you lose all of your programming .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound spectrum is very wide, crisp and clear . Bass is slightly emphasized (and crisp!) but mids\/trebles are well pronounced . Long cord is awesome! Bass is strong, but not overpowering . Comfort will grow on you . The HD212 headphones are very comfortable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are the best sounding headphones on a portable player I've had to pleasure to own . Sound is good, ear get hot though and the ear piece begins to breakdown after awhile so need to replace them . They are meant to be worn on the ear so it is possible to wear these without any discomfort for hours .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Type-R upgrade to ATRAC3 adds better sound and LP modes . Power management is better than anything else out there . Minidisc only spins when data is read from it, so most of the time the device is idle while playing music . The sound is pleasant with the in-ear headphones that Sony makes, but not the throw-away headphones .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The most important and impressive feature of this unit is the G shock protection . It can download the mp3 from you PC also it's fast . Using LP2 mode can hold double songs(about 33) than the normal CD . The sound quality is the same with the CD's (for me, I couldn't tell the difference between them)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The mounting system on back makes it very easy to use in tight spaces . When plugged into any outlet that's on the same AC circuit as a TV (with analog cable) it causes visible interference on lower channel numbers . Disappointed that a brand name like Tripp Lite would have these issues .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer was disappointed with the quality and price that he paid for the CD player . The player skips often, but no backlit LCD makes it hard to tell if you're on the right song . The sound quality on it isn't all that bad, the headphones that the kit supplies are workable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This one has amazing bass combined with very clear sound . The only con is that the buttons on the pad can make it easy to hit track skip when you want to turn the volume up . It may be a bit a money but it is way worth every penny you spend to get it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" MX 500 is a truly universal remote control that will allow you to exile your myriad individual remotes to the coffee table drawer . Every button is backlit (and you can customize the amount of time the remain lit, from one to ten seconds) The function of almost every button can be programmed by learning a command from another .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Jensen speakers were the best purchase I ever made . The sound is incredible, the packaging is small and the price tag is outstanding . Jensen powered subwoofer and 5 suround-sound speakers make for one amazing set . These speakers easily compete with $400-500 high end home theater systems .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Jensen JP-1500 speakers are the best and 2nd longest lasting floor standing stereo speakers . 15 inch woofers blow away most or all subwoofers out there now . They weigh at least 50 pounds each, but they do have handles on the sides for easy movement . For home, awesome for semi-pro audio, very good .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JVC's DX-U20 speakers sound great but cheep plastic was used making the system look somewhat cheaper . The remote feels and is cheep, is uncomfortable to hold and is very badly designed . The maximum bass level (4) is more than enough bass . The sound is crisp at ALL sound levels without being muffled .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The THA5 is not a add for the surround system as implied as implied . This is the third time a product has been misrepresented by Amazon.com and is beginning to cause difficulties for the purchaser . The only negative point is the time to load a media .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This 2nd Generation iPod is one of the best iPods I've ever seen . 10GB iPod holds about 2,000 songs at near CD-quality .

{"text":" Reviewer: Easy to set up, easy to use, good sound quality, great price . Optical digital output cable not included, no MP3 playback, no remote (though Sony receiver remote works fine) Buyer:  Easy-to-use changer. Easy-set-up. Easy to use . Easy to make and play . Easy-easy to use and easy to buy a new player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This system sounds great in my 2 bedroom townhouse with quite a full bass sound . All the speakers included in this package are very clear and have more than enough wattage for home theater . The reciever limits the range of distances you can set . If you set the front speakers at 15' you can't set the rear speakers at 5' .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound isn't crystal clear, but for the price it can't be beat . Outstanding microphone to use at your desk to record voice, lecture, etc. Purchased 6 of these in the last 3 years for our dept. We have tried 5 different microphones and this one is the best .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Minidisc re-records up to 1,000,000 times and holds about 50 songs or 2-3 CD's . G-protection gives basically perfect skip protection . Water resistant, EXTREMELY durable, sporty looking (although a bit bigger than I'd like it to be)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It's not heavy nor clumsy in the hand, the numbers are large and I like that.. Perfect for its simplicity, cheapness and ease of use . Great price & well worth it. Get two for the house! Buy a replacement for an old TV remote that died .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Magnavox universal remote works fine for basic functions, but for choosing set-up functions or episodes on a DVD, it is horrendous . It's lightweight, evenly balanced, and thin - so it should be good for those with small as well as large hands . The instruction manual was good, and I programmed this to control Panasonic VCR, Panasonic TV, and Pioneer DVD player with no trouble .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Dell M6600 laptop comes with a 240 watt power adapter . It uses a capacitor to assist with equipment start-up surges . The fan runs full speed whenever the unit is switched on . Cigar lighter circuits are kind of on the edge when powering a large laptop .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The mount is ready good for handing up a spkr, but, the pieces can be easy to be bent . It's my second one, use it for my rear center speaker . The mount itself offers full a 360 degree tilt and turning radius for aiming your speakers perfectly .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The size\/weight of the N26AWII's are a bit too much for these brackets . They may work well for other speakers, but don't waste your time trying to use these on those JBL's . It was suggested as an add on purchase for the pair of outdoor speakers that I bought .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It only protects to 885 joules for the power circuit while the phone line protection is 160 joule protection . The real test is when a surge occur, but I hate to test it like that... as long as my laptop is unfried, I am cool . It works as advertised and is a good deal for the money .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Air Hogs Helicoter proved to be a frustrating experience for the pilot . The pilot has virtually NO control once the copter lifts off the launching pad .

This toy is not exactly a toy for kids 8+ but more of a fun machine for older people .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only problem is skipping with CD-RW, but it plays regular CD-Rs great . The backlit LCD display makes this CD player very fashonable and easy to use . The player works in regular AA batteries, so you can use rechargable ones or disposables .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RCA 1000B remote is easy to program, easy to read the manual, but it should take an idiot about 20 minutes to get things up and running . The learning function is basically worthless, and the touchscreen is hard to use . If you want to buy a piece of junk, buy the Sony RM-AV3000 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RMAV3000 is well engineered but suffers from 3 flaws that should be considered prior to purchase for less ambitious use . The display is virtually impossible to read under all normal lighting conditions . You must turn on the backlight . This is annoying whether trying to read the display with or without the backlit feature on . The only thing I didn't like about it was the buttons in the middle of the remote .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier has worked extremely well for anyone having a problem with weak signal reception . Would give 5 stars if it were not for the VOD problem, but product information says it works with VOD .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The mega bass feature is what sold me; the sound is excellent . The 30 presets include 15 FM, plus 5 each for TV, AM, and weather . Sony needs to go back to the drawing board to make this device listener-friendly . It is interesting to be able to listen to TV stations on a radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The low-battery indicator does not give one a lead time, one's first indication of a low battery is when the reception degrades or the unit shuts off . The volume I'm a little dissastisfied because when the volume is too high it makes noise like the radio is static . Reception has been fine virtually everytime I've used it .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" TDK MC60 tapes didn't work on 2 sony Microcassette recorders . The tapes may be defective or they don't work with sony products . The audio comes out clear, even after years of playing them . They record great and are little jams, so really are worth the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the best portable MP3 player if you are interested in recording on the fly . It records voice or from any audio source! And it's small enough to fit unobtrusively in your breast pocket . It runs on 2 AAA batteries, and the batteries last for 10 hours .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only problem I found was pressing the 'shoot' button was quite awkward . The camera is rugged and definitely waterproof! Because it doesn't have a flash like other underwater cameras, the picture quality isn't all that great . Only about 20% of our pictures turned out decent for an underwater camera .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Amazon are no longer offering this unit, but if you can find it elsewhere it's well recommended . Sony speakers are driven independently and have robust quality . The price is comparable with most of the other receivers in this class . It isn't as good as my NAD C-740, but shouldn't be at less than 1\/2 the price .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Apple's iPOD is hands down the perfect player . The only problem?  The darn thing is expensive as heck... and one good drop on the sidewalk will break it's delecate internal hard drive . The sound is great - I tested with mp3s that were encoded at 320kbs and it sounded nearly CD perfect .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The AVR 225 is a low to mid range product with high-end capabilities . The 192\/24 DAC for the left and right channel provide better clarity for music than other receivers in this price range . The manual should be improved, it is very hard to read .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Small table top radio with excellent FM world receiving capabilities . It is attractive and has headphones and soft case for portability . Batteries do not last as long as I like . It seems generally very sensitive on all frequencies, except possibly at the low end of the AM broadcast band .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Reviewer says it is easy to switch stations and bands through the presets and to set presets . Audio quality is good enough to listen to talk radio . Sound may be tinny for music, but it sounds good for talk radio more than music . The instructions could have been better written by a 6th grader who commands the English language .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The best radio i,ve hear in along time is the Sangean DT-210Fm-Sterio\/Am PLL Synthesized Pocket Reciever . It is so good that my Husband had me by one for him also . The product came quickly and well packaged....new and in great shape .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is incredible, and even though I am unable to put the rear speakers behind for the full surround sound experience, I am quite pleased with what this system is capable of . There are numerous inputs so you can hook-up your vcr, dvd, playstation, gamecube, etc. The subwoofer is fairly large, but on many other systems this is the case .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" FM reception is outstanding-- NPR sounds great and the system's Concert Hall setting makes you feel you are right there . The two subwoofers pump out a total of 160 Watts; the two speakers 80 Watts; together 240 Watts . The Kenwood NV-301 is cheaper, too .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" JVC MXGT- 700 has 330 watts of power . It can reach down as far as 29Hz without bottoming out . The sound is ugly for a family room but subwoofer sound is better for a small room . The system has 220 of its 330w going to subwoofers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The size is great, not even as big as a 3-note card, and the weight of the unit is no issue . Sound quality is very good for such a small device and I'm impressed every time I use the device . There are no plug-ins for MusicMatch Jukebox, you'll have to use the provided software .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The subwoofer blows you out of your seat, it's great, and you can easily adjust the bass right on the volume control . The speakers are amazing for games like counter-strike and other fps . The speaker system operates like a dream .  The speakers blend very well, especially when listening to music .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The HT-S650 is a strong package with good quality features . The speakers are Magnetically Shielded so the speakers are strong and give out good quality sound . The subwoofer has a built in 150 watt amplifier with an 8&quot; long-throw woofer .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SV-SD80 is the smallest 1.75\" x 1.688\" x 0.688\u2019s (without battery) Comes with a small, sealed(water resistant) hard plastic carry case (w\/belt-clip) which I use almost all the time with single AAA battery; last over 30hrs (tested myself), and is the only way to use a battery . No current support for Napster, iTunes, BuyMusic, or Rhapsody .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SA-HE100 is Dolby Digital EX compatible . There are no component video connectors on the back, just svideo and composite . There is no subwoofer button (the sub can be configured via remote though) The receiver is great for movies too, giving a new dimension to the experience .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Treo 90 is a handy small PDA that does not promise to be anything but a small, handy color PDA . There is still not a PDA out there that can match it for size . There are alternatives for the same price that can offer better screen resolution and speed .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The base boost switch does not boost the base frequencies very much . The quality of the tuner is average, and for not so strong stations, fair . The remote is handy &amp; easy to use . The sound is really amazing considering it is such a small radio .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" WM-FS221 Sports Walkman Cassette Player has a lot of extra features that are a nice improvements over the older models . The design of the product is also poor: the headphone outlet is positioned such that the wire plugs into the bottom of the unit . The on\/off button is exposed to the easiest activation which results in the player unintentionally consuming battery power when not in use .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The EX70LP was launched as part of Sony's 20th celebration of the Walkman . Comes with rubber tips and a special storage case for the earphones only (and not the cords) The sound is great and will be only as good as your recording . High recommended and an excellent buy on Amazon .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony MDR-A35G's sweat guard headphones are a must have for the active person . The sound quality isn't bad at all for the price . The fold-up feature allows you to close them up and stuff them into a pocket when travelling . But the amount of abuse from running on the treadmill will eventually wear out the speakers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The jog switch is not only difficult to use, it is the first thing to suffer from water intrusion . The second issue is where the power cord plugs into the unit . The metal portion of the plug remains visable upon installation . There are no tone controls or equalizer pre-sets to choose from on this player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" One of the discs was not re-writable . Perfect for transferring pictures or files from one computer to another . Almost impossible to find CD-RW's anymore . Working well with no issues . Using for music only to listen to in the car . Working at work to transfer data to home and laptop computers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The light works perfectly, and the fact that it folds down easily for storage . The button that keeps the bulb on doesn't really work, so you have to keep constant pressure down on the button in order to use it . The hood over the light comes off easily so be careful .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Worst DVD playback was the worst I've experienced since I had a first-generation player without a decoder card in my old computer . The player does not do PAL-&gt;NTSC conversion, so you can't watch PAL films without extra hardware . The remote is a tad tricky to figure out, but I didn't have any functionality problems .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only downside with this model and all of the Sony All in One units is the over-heating issue . This is a great buy, especially since the price has gone down from when I bought mine . The sound is great and there have been no performance issues with the DVD player (except for one major issue--to follow).","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony CFD-E75 CD\/Radio\/Cassette Boombox (Silver) is a great product with a reasonable price tag . The sound quality is excellent, although I've never been much of an audiophile . The remote works just fine except I left the player, remote, and some cassettes in a carrying bag for a week or so and the batteries in the remote went dead .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony CFD-E75 CD\/Radio\/Cassette Boombox (Silver) is a compact, stylish and goes anywhere . Sound quality is very good and on a par with other machines in this price range . The user has little control over fidelity beyond volume and mode (stereo or mono)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The alarm clock is compact, attractive, works well and produces fine sound at a small price . Sound quality overall is really good, but the nature sounds are almost comical, not relaxing at all . It picks some signals up too much - one station bled all the way from 91.5 to 90.7 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The quality is great and the length is perfect, it can be used from all the way across my room . It's constructed of quality materials and is a great length for my needs . After only a few uses, this cheap cable broke off in 3 pieces . Do not buy, it's not worth the headache!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" RJ12 cables do not fit tightly, they rattle around inside the couipler, resulting in an intermittent connection . Poor quality construction tolerances, ill-fitting . I ordered the same thing from Mononprice, and the fit was much better, and there was no breakup in my voice transmissions .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cord stays taunt for a few months, then the curls begin to loosen and get tangled . Parents love it; got this cord for my folks' yellowy-beige wall phone . It is susceptible to cord tangles so keep this in mind . It works perfectly well .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The splitter's male connector doesn't even remain in the iPhone - it practically falls out it is so loose . The audio quality the device gives is very very poor . There is no mic channel on this, don't expect to be able to use your phone headset's mic .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Everything is as expected except for the oversized soft plastic covering on the plugs . The overall diameter of the plugs prohibited it from plugging into my phone while it is in the OtterBox case I have it in . After a quick alteration by shaving off some plastic with a utility knife it fits perfectly .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The crossover cable was used to connect my TV to my desktop... then bridge the wireless connection to the wired nic and provide connectivity to the TV . The cable works fine and is a high quality cable . It works great and is at a great price . I like how it is red to differentiate from my other cables .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" I use these for active speakers to cut back on the number of extension cords I carry around . They fit in the IEC socket firmly with no slop, but not too tight either . This gave enough slack to allow for proper articulation . It's a cheap way to simplify setup .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is durable and I am very pleased with the sound quality . The female connection is really secure, so shaking the cable around once I've plugged in my headphones doesn't cause static . The extension came out of the plastic bag without any coil or bend in it . I've always had good experiences with Belkin cables .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is a standard cable of this type . It does not have a right angle connector at one end . It turned out that I didn't need the right angle, and I kept it, and it's working fine . The negative element of my review is focused on the vendor I selected - Technology Galaxy - just simply pick another .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Three 3\/8&#34; wide colorful labeling tapes work as advertised in the Brother P-65 label maker . It sticks well, has never jammed, and is fun to use in different colors . The colors enhance visibility and add a little decorative fun to whatever you're labeling .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The charging poet (male portion of the cable bent after 3 uses, therefofre making the product unusuable . You are way better off using a full non-extended cable . The cable is more easily hideable up along the rafter beams of a gazebo .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Cables to Go provides the extra length I needed for my desktop . They are lightweight, not recommended for power tools, construction sites, etc. But, they are not sold for that kind of work . Admittedly it's a pretty darn long cable, it's well made, and it does it's job .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" C2G makes great cables and this one is no exception . It stretches out to 2.5 times as long as the typical computer cord . One did not work as it arrived, and the other two quit very soon thereafter . Returned to Amazon:  The Tech Basket .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The product cannot be found in stores and helped my business greatly . It was shipped in a timely fashion . The cleaner is easy to use and keeps my floppy-disk drive working perfectly . Not sure how many people still even have a 3.5-#34; floppy disks anymore .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Amazon's Canadian site sells all the great things the American site does, such as clothes, herbs and packaged foods . After a couple of recordings, these discs develop defects and will not play . Some of these discs had to be discarded after recording two or three times . A good product. A good price.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cases are hard to open without breaking them . They are color coded to let you group multiple disks together to ensure a complete set . They take up very little more room than the DVD itself . They come in quite handy to store even backup software discs . The cases provide a very good protection for shipping disks through the mail .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The write speeds are low, but for the use I have, this is just fine . Sony media is almost never faulty, and since I planned to use these with my MP3 collection for my car audio, it was important that I don't use a disc that kept skipping . 4 out of the 5 Memorex discs refused to be written to properly .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable plugs right into the headphone jack of any audio player or even a laptop . It won't provide surround sound, but it is an inexpensive stereo 3.5mm cable that works fine, I have had no problems with it . These are the best value audio cables I've bought from Amazon .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Some cases I used would break off where the top and bottom part of the Cd case was connected over time . These are about the same as most and will probably be back, when they have the best price to offer . They're nothing fancy but quite adequate for their intended purpose .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The see-through sleeve is made of vinyl and it just plain feels as if it will last a long time . The label label label shows through the front pocket, and the back pocket holds the info insert . The extra space can become a minor problem--if the Ideastream or any other similarly sized CD\/DVD sleeve holder box is full, you just may have to push the title space back to make sleeves fit inside the box .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The price of the Fellowes 25-pack jewel cases was outstanding . 20% of the cases were broken at the hinges . The cases are not sturdy enough for every day use . They will protect CDs, MP3s that are being stored, but frequent use could damage them .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cases were loosely wrapped with self sealing plastic wrap . The first 2 cases were broken & unusable . Out of the 100 cases 95 were usable & 5 were broken . They are really nice fit plenty in storage boxes . The advertisement was deceiving for me because the picture included the disk but that was not product .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust . Paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage . The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" One of the jewel cases on one end was cracked when I opened the package . Out of the 50 I got, 6 of them were broken and a few more had cracks in them from the shipping . They are affordable and your average cases- nothing special but then again they weren't really meant to be .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" They come in five different colors -- red, orange, purple, green, and blue . The cases crack easily if you're not careful with them . Some people say my place looks like a recording studio. I have so many recordable CDs and DVDs that I can't buy these fast enough .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Two cases were broken when I opened the package, another broke when I tried to open it, and, overall, they are flimsy . Made from very thin but flexible plastic . All 30 cases are about 6 inches long and are 6 inches wide . Nice & compact & great quality!","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cases are too fragile, and they are not real easy to open . Several of mine arrived with one of the plastic hinges broken off, so the case does not stay connected . They do what they are supposed to do, protect discs . The price was reasonable, and none arrived broken .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is the second of these I've purchased, and I will continue to do so . It's a very cheap way to have decent cases on-hand when burning discs periodically . They come in a variety of five colors: red, blue, green, orange and purple .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Memorex disks are the first CD-RW disks with both, 700MB capacity AND high speed 4-12X . They record nothing! Garbage! The discs do not work with my computer . They come in red box instead of blue and come in blue .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are some of the best jewel cases I've bought . If you want a durable and strong case; these are the ones to buy! So much better than the poorly-constructed Maxell - 12 Pack of CD jewel cases . They are sturdy enough for what I need, but probably aren't the toughest cases around .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony's NW-MS11 plays music in ATRAC format, which is a different format for music compression, just like mp3 . The sound quality is great, and the physical product is top of the line . The device also comes with a pair of earphones, which I'd rate a 3 in a 1-5 scale .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Belkin F6H500 UPS units have been poorly designed . USB and XP compatibility is not compatible with Windows XP or USB . USB is adequate for MP3 players, but it is too unreliable for a utility that's meant to protect your system from power outages .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It's larger than the typical cord, but that's a good thing by me because it leaves room for some bigger plugs . It feels solid and works well . It was supposed to have USB outlets  but it does not have them . Outlets too close together are not enough outlets .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It offers you 10 outlets for even  bulky plugs that usually takes up at least 2-3 outlets near it . The two \\\\\"Always On\\\\\" plugs have been extremely useful . There's not a lot of wasted space on the unit itself, and the adjustible plug is helpful .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The 9 outlets are a plus but the outlets are bit tight to use, I dont know why big players like Belkin do  a poor job in standard sizes . The item is not as pictured . It works like a champ. I'm a little unhappy since it does not match my other stuff . Other than that, everything is okay .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" LCD display is always on and is a bit too bright for a dark room . The power cord is very thick, and black; whick looks odd with such a small, white clock . There is no battery back-up in case of a power outage or blown fuse .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sturdy, durable, easy to listen to while on the move . Works really well, auto loops without glitches or need to press a button . Only uses one battery which lasts a very long time . The belt clip does not stay clipped . The old version was much better .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Sony ICF-CD853V CD\/Radio\/... Alarm clock . Big display (easy to read), digital tuner, nice button layout, easy to set alarms, brightness control (although manual) Cons: cannot set alarms separately for weekdays\/weekends, no gentle wake, not-dimmable LEDs that shine brigther than the LCD screen .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The power drive woofer makes all the difference in the world to the overall sound . The sound only distorts at he highest volume and that is extremly loud . The line-in feature has a hum\/buzz that will not go away . There are not enough clear, crisp highs on any of the settings . The bass is muddy .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The RCA Universal Adapter worked perfectly, allowing me to use my CD player using an AC outlet instead of batteries . The kit comes with so many different configurations that choosing the correct tip was easy . Now if I could just keep the cat from chewing these!! I love this, use it on my mp3 player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The power adaptor can be used for many different types of electronics . The Kindle Gen 1 charger does not work well if you use it appropriately . It shorted out\/burned out my Kindle after unplugging the charger . It was slow to ship, but worth the wait .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The headphones are very light, with fairly small earpads . They fold very nicely to fit into the carrying pouch (included) Battery life is decent, one single battery lasted the flight Paris and a flight to Hawaii from the East Coast . Sound quality is iffy, they don't cancel out everything, only certain frequencies .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The TSU1000 and TSU2000 universal remotes have been used since 1999 . Programmable macros are the best feature of the remote . Monochrome screen is OK, but not great . Backlight stays on for a very short time...and you are FORCED to look at the screen instead of feeling for a hard button .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It only holds 3 CD's, comforably without cases (there are pockets) Hard to mess with CD-player on the move (it gives you a weird angle). Hard-to-mess with CD player on the . move . A bit tight for some CD-players . A little too small .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The MZ-N1 is made of solid metal, and can easily withstand the expected bangs and clashes in your bag or pocket . USB cradle makes transferring songs fast and incredibly easy . Remote control is excellent, and will make you wonder how you ever got along without a remote control .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" 320 minutes of music on 1 minidisc is an excellent deal . I love the MD player just wish that Music jukebox supported it as well as the sonic stage . I think the controls on the sonic stages program are hard to understand . Some of my MP3 files are not compatable with the atrc3 system .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The player automatically defaults to auto-level every time you stop recording and you have to change it back to manual every time . The conversion from MP3 to ATRAC is fast... others must just have slow computers as mine transferred a whole playlist in less than 5 min! The player is also reliable (version 2.2) and seems to work fine with Windows XP .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Maxell 5-Pack High Speed CD-RW Blank Media ( PC \/ Mac ) didn't produce a better quality of sound . When you put the CD into the Disclab, the LCD screen will say 'Reading media' for almost 5 minutes . If you have a Roland CDX-1, use the TDK High Speed discs .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Hosa Premium midi cables have thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports . Metal tipped cables are very durable, and if need be, they are easy to take apart and repair . The connectors are metal, and the cables are sturdy rubber or vinyl but flexible .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is dual (MIDI IN \/ MIDI OUT) and each connector and its cable is very well identified.. given the price is an excellent choice . The main attractiveness to me (studio use, mostly permanent attachment) was price, cable length and cable configuration (two leads per cable)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Hosa has been a workhorse brand for me and I keep going back to them whenever I need a reliable cable for gigging and practice . The rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cord works great and for the price you can't get any cable this nice for that . It disconnects easy, so not a very good cable for gigging with . The cord is flexible and the cloth is pretty flexible too . It has good colors, but after awhile the connection started to get static-y .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These connectors are very low profile which allows you to put you pedals close together . They fit very tight in the jacks so you won't accidentally pull them out or shake them out in transport . These cables work great if you have space restrictions on your pedal board . It allows the pedals to be spaced 3\/4 inches apart .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The plugs are great but the wires are pretty thin and can easily be damaged . The wiring inside the cable will be significantly more susceptible to the rigors of gigging . The more-rigid Dotcom-style coax cables are probably a better bet if you have (or plan to have) a larger system .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable takes a mono XLR external mic and puts the mono signal on both the left and right stereo channels of your camcorder that has a 3.5 mm stereo mic input . It works fine and is as advertised . Not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is a great way to interface your guitar or bass to your computer for recording and editing . It's a good way to use a battery powered condenser on these cameras . It works with my DSLR (Nikon D300s) and my Android phone (Sony Xperia Z1 Compact)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer . It doesn\u00b4t seems high quality, but its enough for the buck ... to soon to tell more, fast shipping and the product is just as described . It did not do what I needed it to do .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Cable works great and is of good build quality . Would recommend to anyone who needs to convert from rca to quarter inch . Great for home audio and recording situations! If you can't use it, you can use it on the XBOX 360 or XBox 360 .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" HOSA cables are not pro grade cables, but the features they have are very close to them . The pro cables use a slightly higher grade of oxygen free copper for a hotter audio signal . The cables are designed for unbalanced audio environments, which covers just about every consumer and mid-pro level environment .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The plugs\/terminals are where most all cable failures occur, so Hosa's extra solid manufacturing efforts are appreciated . The seem pretty tough too, I just wrap them up and throw them in a bag with other cables and there's no damage after doing that a few times and leaving them in there for a week .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The black end of the cable plugs into the earphone socket on my surround system . The socket is larger than the cable adapter that came standard with the headphones . The cable is very beefy and durable and serves its function very well . It may have been a little pricey, but it makes up for it in quality .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable snake was a welcomed addition to my recording studio . Used it for recording going from my interface to the mixing board. Used it to connect from direct-outs from mixer to a unit that sends dedicated channels to in-ear monitors on stage at church . The package arrived quicker than expected, and without damage .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Product was as described, delivery was prompt . Not a 2.5mm for xbox controller...actually a 3.5 mm adapter . Not as good as the metal end cables . Perfect for plugging in my MP3 player into the auxiliary jack in my CR-V .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Straight 1\/4&#34; cable puts too much stress on the top of the guitar . 'angle plug' cables are a bit hard to find in high quality cables . The female end of the connection is loose and any movement will cause you a lost signal .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The connections tend to get loose in the housing and cause popping and crackling noises when moved . Not the greatest quality switch on the face of the planet, but works as expected and at a good price . After three months the switch pushed into the unit and no longer functioned .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Hosa GMP-272 L-shaped 90-degree adapter is a cord saver . It works well with most plug-in mics sold in the market like the sony ECM-D70xx and Olympus mics . It protects the plug and if I accidentally get up my headphones unplug easily .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These adapters worked just fine at connecting scanner radios to a computer via a couple of ground-loop isolators . The scanners and computer have 1\/8 . (3.5mm) TRS jacks and the isolators have RCA male connectors . The RCA connectors give a very snug fit, which makes for a reassuringly sturdy connection .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The XLR has tension on it this plug will have signal issues because its not a tight connection . The product is manufactured to a very high standard . The price that is makes it a necessity for your current or future audio needs . The connection it makes when plugged up is not good .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The box itself was 10 times larger than it needed to be and it was shipped in an 8-1\/2\/34; x 11&#34; envelope, tons of waste . Dont hesitate to buy if you need one . The only thing I wish they'd improve is the packaging .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cable is for mono application and not stereo . It has a little static when moving the plug but this is probably my mixer . I like reliable basic cables that get the job done at a great price . I use this cable to play my bass guitar through my subwoofers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Y cable attachment attachment has worked admirably for when I'm not playing my drums with my beats audio headphones on . The cable is made with quality components and I would never expect it to fail . The loudspeaker that came bundled with the Roland drum set I bought only came with a mono cable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Hosa makes a great cord that splits the headphone feed into two lines so two people can listen to playback while recording . Not everyone knows that TRS jacks can be either mono or stereo . Nice cable for a great price . No snap crackle pop. Nice cable .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The wiring is not only stiff but has extra strong memory (read: cable does not relax or straighten out) It's also too short to connect my headphones to the rear of my headphone amp . I recommend the MediaBridge 3.5mm version over this even if it's twice as expensive .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is not the product you are looking for . This unit only CUEs and OUTPUT MONO AUDIO . This split did exactly what I needed and what it was advertised to do . The stereo separation is outstanding . Good for travel and good for music lovers .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The design keeps stress off of the audio jack with the weight of the adapter and cord, this takes a lot of stress of the jack . A little expensive for what it does... but then again, nobody else seems to want to sell something like this . The adapter is hard to find and extension with a right angle input .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The cord is an IEC C9 cord, NOT an extension cord . It is an odd cord since this was just before the world settled on the IEC standard cords that are in everything from computers to heaters . It has two prongs and isn't polarity keyed . Nobody nor their brother has these in stock .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The color coding system of these snakes makes sense to have in a dimly lit studio crammed in behind your racks . Shipped quickly and just as low noise as some $100 cables . If you are looking for D Sub cables that are good quality but don't cost an arm and a leg, this product is a must have .","product_category":"Electronics"}
