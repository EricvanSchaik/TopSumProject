Now, i'm getting ready to take it back. what's wrong with it? Here we go...<br />1) The LED is WAY to bright. It has a dimmer switch on the back, but since the it's not the numbers that light up, but rather the screen, even on the lowest setting it is like a mini-floodlight; alright from across the room but not nice next to your bed. <br />2) The CD alarm plays for a half hour and then goes to this smoke-alarm on steroids beeping. Alright when you are asleep, but when you wake up to a CD and start puttering around getting ready, and the beep hits, you immediately start looking for the fire. <br />3) The radio doesn't work. It gets good reception, but for some odd reason it won't register anything below 97.0 on the FM dial, no matter what position the marker is in. 3 out of the 4 tolerable stations are now unreachable for me. <br />4) The CD player isn't freindly in the morning. After the beep is shut off, the CD player seems uncertain that you actually want to hear music, even after you've pushed play. If you are lucky, you will get a song or two out before self-doubt overwhelms it and it stops playing at all. <br />5) the &quot;dual alarm&quot; is misleading. One alarm is CD, the other is radio. You can't set it to play a CD at one 6:00am, and then again at 8:00am; one of those has to be radio. Basically, rather than a dual alarm, it is two single alarms. If that makes sense. Which it should. <br />6) The CD player opens if you breathe on it. Well, not literally, but it has a hard time distingishing between an attempt to open the CD cover and any other movement anywhere near / on the clock. I have no idea why this is, but I swear that it opened twice this morning while it was fiddling with the radio. <br />Anyway, now that i know what can go wrong in one of these things, I'll know what to look for when i return this one.\", 'Bought this in early 2000; I left for college and my parents kept it.

I've taken other cars to other places in the city in the past that didn't leave a lasting impression. Not only am I happy about the quality, I really enjoyed my conversation with the woman who did it. Yes, I said woman and she was fantastic. I did meet Mr. G, who  was doing most of the tinting and we had an educated conversation about world history and culture. Needless to say, I felt enlightened with my new acquaintances and I enjoyed watching them work efficiently. And I'm all about supporting local businesses with quality services, especially supporting the working woman! The service was cash only and I tipped over 25% because of a job well done.

I ordered Chicken Fingers which were almost $10 and were overcooked and dry. You have to wait an uncomfortable amount of time for your food here.
