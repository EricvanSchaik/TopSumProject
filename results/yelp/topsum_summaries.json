The buffalo chicken dip and chicken fingers were great . Beers are all great and the owner is constantly looking for ways to make your experience better.

It's in the Pearl which is the hot spot in Portland-I was looking forward to it. Bluehour definitely falls into the category of \"Cool\" places in Portland. The food was very, very good as well as the decor quite a bit, and their private dining room is spectacular: cozy, intimate and completely removed from the main restaurant, it has its own bar and even its own bathroom .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"5HAuhk6_h5t7j6fk983QZg","text":" Edible Canada is a place I dine at regularly and I thought I'd write an update . The duck poutine was exceptional, and the po'boy was really good . The food was cooked with integrity (my steak was delicious) and the cocktails were really well made and satisfying . But the service was sloppy, as the waitress did not build rapport or romance the menu .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"5Yjlkds0PtfGhiNPMWIRIw","text":" The food itself can sometimes be standard thai food, but there are two key standouts that we personally must get here: the Pad Thai and the crab puffs . The food is full, not too crabby tasting- but clearly made with crab, and (I'm pretty sure) you get 8 to an order . It does come with peanut sauce and that's not always a given with Pad Thai, so I guess that detail helps Beau Thai keep its two stars .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"6dB2_doBzgx3SGkgyMA96g","text":" The Boy enjoyed his Spicy Pork BBQ but portions here are pretty small for the price . The only downside to this place is that they don't do Korean BBQ . Kaju's primary focus is on tofu jjigaes (stews) and tofu stew like kimchi jigae .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"8I2CBbVJnWS8w8OfkexE8g","text":" The wait time wasn't that long on a Friday night even though it was packed, the service was very friendly and the food! Their clam chowder has to be the best I've ever tasted, we were tempted to buy another to go . The wait times weren't long even though the food was great, and the chowder was really good, its more of a creamy soup with a hint of spice .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"9P-lp3AWDXGayDqJz9VPwQ","text":" The broth was rich and flavorful with just enough salt to my liking, and noodles perfectly cooked . Condiments including green onions, pork belly chashu, nori, and soft boiled egg, spinach, and fungi were all fresh and complimented the ramen . Noodles were chewy and not soggy; the noodles were just luke warm and oily . The pork in the tonkotsu is tender but too smoky; the pork in my soup was a bit dry, the egg was overcooked, and the only other items in the bowl were canned bamboo shoots and two nori sheets .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"A5A8dP2q7_j1_jmKDjDz6w","text":" There really wasn't anything there that wasn't really quite delicious. Sushi rolls are also creative and somewhat fresh. This is the best place in boston for Sushi. It's a decent sushi joint in a great area of the city. The edamame was huge but could have used a little more salt on the top and less on the bottom .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"AcWbIflEot9KREPF4Wl6Bg","text":" Market Basket is an exceptionally good organization, says author .

Their Taro Smoothies are also very good!","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"CzplV6UpIdABR5sRq8hjog","text":" The only pluses are the amazing view in the Sun Dial bar and the Starbucks in the lobby . The hotel is nice and comfortable, but the billing department is terrible . The rooms are small and run down, but bed bugs are tracked in somewhat often .

The rice and the Yucca are the reason why this place gets one star above the worst . The chicken with garlic shrimp lacked flavor and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"IJ3_k1RWijwKiVJhlYVjeQ","text":" The food really really really realllllllllyyyyyyyy delicious!! I had disliked Thaifood because It is very spicy but when I came here I love all of their food even though it's spicy . From pad thai to ginger chicken rice to fish, all have been great! Gov Deval Patrick is a regular here . The Pad Thai does not disappoint- It tastes so fresh and is consistently good- The Pad Thai was done well, relatively cheap and ready in 15 minutes, and comes in one of those cool plastic containers I hold on to bring lunch in the next few days .","product_category":"Desserts"},{"product_id":"JZOwGxrg_fg4tdyglqCIWg","text":" The Japanese sushi chefs are all gone .

The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water .
