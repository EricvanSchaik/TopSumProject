{"text":" The Acoustic Research HT181 Optical Digital Cable is a wonderful choice if you are looking to take your stereo system to the next level . The cable is the perfect match for those of us who are watching our money and want a good quality product .

{"text":" These headphones have three features not found together on any other headphones at any price: (a) single-entry cord; (b) nice loooong cord! (c) reasonably flat-sided earpieces, with swivel even, so you can wear them comfortably when your head's on a pillow - like in bed . The sound of the JM10 however, however, is absolutely unfit for human listening; the sound is so weak, you could barely tell they are working .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The tuning knob on the headphone set itself (you tune it  to work with the base station) is very easy to accidentally turn -- thereby knocking it out of commision . Within the first week of using them, I've already had to retune several times (only takes a few seconds, but it's annoying)","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" I bought this as a last ditch attempt to save my DVD-RW, but the drive was unsalvagable . I have now used it on all my disc related devices. They all faired much better.

{"text":" This lens cleaner is great for both cd and dvd players . It takes off the static as well as cleaning the players, with its carbon technology .

{"text":" Car CD players have a front loading mechanism, as opposed to a tray or top loading, and the instructions specifically say not to use it -- bacause this damages the brushes . It helped a little with my CD-ROM, but I highly doubt it could ever solve the neverending issue of a dirty car CD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Allsop 2-in-1 Audio Cleaner:  Many years ago I recorded a very fine collection of audio tapes .

{"text":" The transmitter plugs right into my computer &amp; the speakers follow me anywhere in the house so I can listen to my MP3's or the Steeler game from NFL . The sound breaks up near 150-175', more so if there are a lot of walls andamp; obstructions . The speakers are heavy but small enough to be unobtrusive once placed, and the sound is extremely lively .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Radio does not have atrack counter so you  don't know what track your playing . It doesn't have a track counter or track counter but for this price, who  cares? The Radio is by no means a high quality stereo. It's very small an light which is another good feature. It does a great job in the OR where it does a good job.  One major problem is that it doesn\u2019t have a  track counter.  It's a radio for meetings and when I finally got it Iwas very dissapointed.  They did miss one thing the Radio does .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" With the color pattern i am able to label both ends of my cables making it a cinch to locate the one I'm looking for, and if you need to extend the cables out it is very simple and also simple to wrap them up again .

The player can't be used on a playlist, shuffle, and repeat tracks .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is a lot better  than I expected for the money, even with the headphones that come with it . It gets a little confusing knowing which direction the tape is going when I want to rewind or fast forward .

{"text":" The machine could not be defeated as it clean them spotless each time just from the hi-speed spinning of the discs in the fluid! No rubbing and scratching involved! For a unit that is supposed to handle numerous cleanings, its performance was extremely poor . Clearly, it's a superior method of cleaning due to the no touch cleaning process .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The SC 340 works as advertised, but it did not control the on-screen menus on a RCA Satellite box, although it can turn the device on and off, change volume, channels and channels . The bulletin board at the Jensen web site does acknowledge this, but the information is buried in the customer bulletin board . It was difficult to tell if the auto program scan was working properly and after becoming impatient, I gave up and did it myself .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" KLH 970 speakers (5-40watt) are the best value speakers I have ever seen . They deliver a great range of sound in a small package . The black doesn't make good friends in bright sun, but you can mount these to the porch or patio roof\/overhang and leave these out in damp weather with no loss of wear or sound . The more I looked around at different facilities with PA or sound systems outdoors, the more I have noticed these speakers being utilized .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than I thought they would (6 years now and all year long outdoor usage) The sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations.  The sound and durability for the money.  Have lasted a few years now.   Great value for the pricing I paid. I bought these several years ago for listening outside .","product_category":"Electronics"}

I don't know if i need buy another cable or do i connect it to my  PC speaker or sound card .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The Sharp MD-MS722 is a great product and would have gotten five stars if  not for a few minor details:\u00a0the cables that you get with it won't  fullfill all of your needs the composite cable has scratchy sound while the digital opic cable had great sound but it couldn't connect to either of my computers or any stereos so you have to get yourself a third cable . Other people said in their reviews that the directions were a little sketchy but they were only minutly bad .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" It takes a little time  to write the name of the songs in this because this Minidisk player does  not have a Jog-Dial in it . An Mp3 player can only hold a few hours of music at the most but with the right adapter can hold unlimited music with great sound . The Optical Digital Input included in this has unbelievable  sound  better than CD sound .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" I'm not an audiophile, but for my fairly simple needs, it makes a big difference to have the subwoofer, and I've never heard any signs of distortion or anything like that . I like the feature where it auto-senses when to turn on, so I don't have to worry about turning on\/off another component .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" These are small for one, well-built and sound great to boot!  They make a nice addition to a partially assembled system like mine, and really round out the sound . Sound quality was poor with no definition. They emit a constant hum as soon as they're turned on .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" SurgeArrest model wasn't very good, which is misleading when it gives you up to 8 outlets to connect your devices to. It burnt out pretty quickly, and the indicator that's mean to alert you of it no longer working never was lit in the first place . The incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for APC to handle .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Energizer batteries suffer from rapid self-discharge problem (that is, can't hold a charge for more than a few days even while not in use), and have very limited lifespan (capacity deteriorated badly after just a few dozen cycles) Around mid-2010, Eenerizer finally started to introduce a new series to address this problem . The series is named 'Recharge' and it claims to hold charge up to one year .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" When the batteries are exhausted (used in my Nikon Coolpix 950) the charge takes about 4 to 6 hours to bring them back to 1-35V . The batteries have never fallen off while recharging, but when you insert them, you get the feeling that they may fall off .","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" The pages can still be flipped quickly even if they are all full, even if CD-R\/RW pages are flipped quickly . This book eliminates that problem; very handy, if slightly overpriced, and easy to carry around with CD's . If you have a ton of CDs, and bring them a lot of places (If you are a dance teacher or travel a lot or are a DJ) these are perfect .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This is an OK unit, and if you want the nifty remote control learning feature (it switches source whenever it detects you using a remote for a differnt source) But it forces you to have all s-vhs or all composite\/rca connection NOT a mixture as is the case for nearly all of us . For example, your DVD player will have s- vhs but your vcr is 99% likely to only have composite\/RCa . This box does not convert composite\/rima to s-Vhs . So how does this box handle this delema?","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The remote worked fine for my GE TV and Sanyo VCR; it also did about 85% of what I needed it to do for my Harman-Kardon Receiver . The problem that I had with it though, is that it did not work for my RCA CD player or DVD player; I would not recommend this remote .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" This remote is so large that I need both hands to use it . It has no VCR Plus button, so you can't use the codes in the TV Guide . Backlighting isn't as great a feature as I thought - sometimes you hit the wrong button just to get it to flash and then it flashes too briefly as you're racing to find the right button . The remote does not operate menus on my Toshiba or Pioneer DVD player .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The sound quality is not bad, although the reception can be a bit static-y if you are around lots of interferring equipment or concrete or concrete . Good for the money:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I've had this radio for about 3 months . The headset is great, never falling out of my ears with daily 30 minute running use . Unfortunately, the headset stopped working this week due to a broken wire inside the connector .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The reception is good up to 100 feet with line of sight, but only about half of that through a wall . The ear pieces are skimpy and the head band hurts when worn (much to small) Idon't know if there is a larger set availible I didn't see any thing on line. I am sure I will have to replace the AW720 soon. The earpieces are comfortable and provide good sound quality .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" Why Case Logic discontinued these I'll never know? Back in my DVD collecting days there were my chosen medium of storage and protection . I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. You can mark the outside of the wallets with a white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet. Trust me.","product_category":"Electronics"}

{"text":" Panasonic Shockwave CD Player represents the future standard for portable digital audio . Batteries were a concern for me but it has a built  in battery charger! Another thing, I didnt find the display hard to read. And after a minute I just memorized were the buttons were. I use mine on the road, in the car, running, you name it.","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The limiting factor with this case is that its impossible to shuffle around sheets of cds . This case has plenty of room for stuff and is great for my CD player, cds, and headphones . It has been great for storing media   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and all have been great to store media .","product_category":"Electronics"}
{"text":" The only complaint I have is that the headphones are not very  comfortable. I would recommend buying a more comfortable pair of  headphones to go with this player. I bought this walkman and didn't expect such a great performance from such a cheap walkman.  I bought my first Walkman  It cost about 80 bucks and didn\u2019t even have a radio or auto-reverse.  This portable stereo has it all and at a very reasonable price. It sounds good too and the microprocessor equalizer control helps you fine-tune the unit for your personal sound  preference.","product_category":"Electronics"}
