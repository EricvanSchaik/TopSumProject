{"text":" These headphones dampens ambient noise and allows me to hear more clearly . The sound quality for movies and music (through Sirius and satellite) is AMAZING . The cord from the base to plug-in has totally disintegrated . Amazon refused to replace it for me, and actually charged me a $17 for the privilege of taking back it ."}
