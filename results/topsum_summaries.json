{"text":" Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones when used as a TV remote listening system emitted a . sudden deafening &#34;explosion type . sound which has caused a major uncorrectable permanent hearing loss in one ear . The charging base has two frustratingly short wires you need to accommodate . Auto-shutoff is probably the worst feature I've ever seen . The blast of loud sound happens after pausing my audio output for a few minutes! The 4\/5-star reviews led to disappointment! Good value for the money. Reception is good from at least 30 feet. Good surround sound effect"}
{"text":" HDMI cables are digital, so they will either work or not work . The more expensive cables are a waste of money if cheap cables work . Don't be fooled by the gold plated ones at BestBuy for $100.00 . Buy this if you have 5$ laying around and you won't regret it ."}
{"text":" The mounting plate has a bunch of configurations and it comes with a free level and HDMI cable . Only problem was the HDMI cable came broken! One end was completely ripped off! Parts were missing the most crucial screws were 1\/2 missing not good . The instructions are terrible, but for the price and quality alone I give 5 stars . Amazon rejected my first review of this product where I stated I received the wrong product ."}
{"text":" Prototype does not fit properly with my Westinghouse TV because it prevents power and HDMI wires from being inserted into TV back . This is by far the WORST WALL MOUNT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!! This BRACKET CAN NOT BE TILTED BECAUSE OF the . SAFETY SCREWS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO SCREW IN!!! I GUESS YOU GET WHAT U PAY for... The HDMI cable included with this product is defective - get no signal from cable box to new plasma TV ."}
{"text":" The Pro-Tec Athletics IT Band Compression Wrap worked great for a 16-mile hike . Two of the three caused static to appear on the screens of the TVs . Comcast techs came to the house when we were having problems with service and they took it oout and said it wasn't necessary . The cable failed to properly display 1080p in PS3 games ."}
{"text":" Cheetah Mounts customer service is incredible . Amazon waited a week to ship my item, punishing me for using free shipping . Amazon seems to have a 'price on demand' scheme going, where they raise and lower the price almost daily, depending on demand . The arm is very heavy and poorly made. There is no quick release of any kind, so you must bolt the VESA plate to the back of the TV and hold the TV ."}
{"text":" Panasonic's headphones are very inexpensive but the sound quality is very poor . They are hollow sounding and weak . For 3 bucks these headphones are insanely good for the price . The only problem that I could see happening would be the loss of a rubber ear piece and a dog or child eating it ."}
{"text":" HDMI cable gives a crisp, clean signal and is a good complement to any system . With digital cables, all the fancy features aren't necessary . The price was right and the quality seems to be on par with most low- to medium-grade cables ."}
{"text":" The Leaf Indoor Amplified Antenna does not loose signal, does not block its line of sight, signal will lose signal . The range on this can be iffy, but no cable bill is worth it . The only negative about this Leaf, is mine didn't come with any adhesive to mount the antenna ."}
{"text":" AmazonBasics are thick, sturdy, thick insulation around the cables, they plug securely into all of my connections . The color-coded bands are nice to help keep things straight . The price is A+. quality C- but this makes me think that the cheaper price makes the quality of the product vastly inferior to higher priced products ."}
{"text":" The Bose SoundLink Mini stopped working 40 days after purchase and is not covered under warranty\/replacement . The JBL FLIP does not sound as rich but works like a mamm . The product is hard to buy because it's hard to pair with . It takes a long time to charge and you'll get a 12-hour charge . The reviewer is disappointed with the battery life of the device ."}
{"text":" DKnight Magicbox is either incredibly loud or the volume is so low you can't hear it . The battery life was also super weak . Amazon won't accept the return at this time, so I might as well throw it away - what a waste of money ."}
