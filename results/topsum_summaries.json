The remote works great for the first time, but not the second time. The remote costs $99.99 for the most .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"0528881469","text":" The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Excellent screen size and resolution. The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often. The unit has a bad probleum with the 12 volty pulg in the 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed. Buyer beware! They are pieces of junk. Otherwise do not buy it it is the worst and most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought.","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"0594296420","text":" At $10, the Nook Charger is a touch pricey at about $10 but i'm happy with the charger . Don't buy just by the picture displayed, make sure to read the description of the product. \u00a0I bought this item to replace the original charger that I'd lost. I am still missing the USB cable.\u00a0I was disappointed when I noticed the box only had the adapter, as the original box had both the plug and adapter .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"0594451647","text":" The cable is working and I can display what's on my nook onto a TV screen, but as soon as you start playing the movie the TV side goes black and you can then only see the image on the nook . Cord could be a bit longer, but works okay - just have to have nook close to the tv .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"0966185056","text":" A rich repertoire of beautiful Christmas music with various and numerous scenes of holiday symbols and events . When you can't always see the TV screen to see the beautiful X-mas scenery we can still hear the wonderful holiday music playing. This is a MUST HAVE video which I find is excellent for gift-giving. It along with our other holiday movies are played often throughout the month of December. It is a very thorough, relaxing Christmas-season video. I play this one all year long - very peaceful and very peaceful. But if you're going to have to pay  much more than that, it's a must-have video .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"097185548X","text":" This has been a great way to refresh my memory on several of the things I already know and practice them . They are very entertaining and extremely knowledgeable . Dave Ramsey's transformation is amazing! He's turned his life around to be a financial wizard and has learned how to accelerate getting out of debt years sooner than he otherwise would have done . He's so much more financially responsible with his retirement planning\/investment funds\/insurance policies and especially of conscious spending of his money .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"0972683275","text":" The part is that once I figured it out, I didn't need the missing parts, and it works like a charm. The length of the screws that came with, but I had other washers to use so it worked out ok. It was VERY stiff and took quite a bit of muscle to loosen it up enough to adjust it. The installation was simple but mounting the actual TV wasn't. The mount was installed level and the first arm is level but the second arm is not up easily. However, it fits my needs and for the price I am satisfied.","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"1400501776","text":" The ability to adjust the sizing of the words is what sold me, and it's also good for me to email and check Facebook!!

It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant.

The previous owner changed the battery so thumbs up to her!","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"3056508193","text":" The instructions aren't the most useful, but I used this YouTube video to help me put it together (all cardboards are virtually the same): https:\/\/www.com\/vr.org\/ The instructions are not the most helpful, but the instructions are easy and fun to assemble .

Great price on this product as the big box stores charge much more for a product that really does not perform any better than Best Buy .

It works and can fit in any computer bag without taking a space as standard cable would do! There is \u201cnullification\u201d Now that\u2019s interesting reading but I don\u2019t think it applies .
