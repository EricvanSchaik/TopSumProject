The price was a good deal for the HOSA cable brand,\u00a0 it seems pretty durable for the price you pay . The cable snake is perfect size to go to my firewire interface to record out of my Front Of House mixer without a big mess of cables . I would recommend this cable-set for anyone on a tight budget .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O37","text":" Hosa has the most reliable cables around, but this time a bad wire out of of the box caused a problem with the X11's X11 headset cable . The cable is the one that is used for the turtle beach headsets, so all these reviews about it working perfect and is better than the OEM is a lie .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O3N","text":" A straight 1\/4&#34; cable puts too much stress on the top of the guitar and 'angle plug' cables are a bit hard to find in high quality cables . HOSA cables are very small gauge wire, and there appears to be no twisting or shielding (which good audio cables need) Don't buy these cheap items for any serious audio applications .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O3O","text":" It was purchase for a church, for a mic extension, that was very needed for mic podium, that suits many speakers . The switch is not the greatest quality switch on the face of the planet, but works as expected and at a good price . Buy with caution because switch pushed into the unit and no longer functioned .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O48","text":" The right angle adapter kept connecting and disconnecting as I drove, so I can't use it . The Hosa GMP-272 L-shaped 90-degree adapter is a cord saver . The adapter protects the plug and if I accidentally get up my headphones unplug easily . The right-angle adapter protects my headset cable especially when I use it in the airplane .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O49","text":" These adapters worked just fine at connecting it all up . The sound was no worse than before when I was using straight 1\/8 TRS male-to-male patch cables . I bought 6 of them in order to connect 4 scanner radios to a computer via a couple of ground-loop isolators .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O4I","text":" After only the first time using it, the quarter inch end started coming loose . The price that is makes it a necessity for your current or future audio needs . The sound quality would go down last DJ  show it didnt work to good with it  i\/f your going to DJ using a laptop you rather get a sound card .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O4N","text":" It was more expensive than I would have liked and should have been $1-$2 cheaper but I guess you have to pay a disproportionate amount of money to get good build quality . Dont hesitate to buy if you need one, since I won't be heavily using it. It looks and feels strong and works well, and I love the design. Can't beat a metal build(Unless the metal causes signal interference in certain applications of course)","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O4X","text":" Good quality basic cables that get the job done at a great price . Worked perfectly and fit perfectly with my monster audio cable! \"Worked perfectly\" \"I ordered 2 of these for a mixer I needed to split between an amp and a computer line in port\" \"This one works for me,\" says one customer .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O55","text":" The cable is made with quality components and I would never expect it to fail . The cables I biught have worked flawlessly.  The cable works perfectly. The loudspeaker that came bundled with the Roland drum set I bought only came with a mono cable and for this I know not why .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O56","text":" Out of all purchases I've made online I'm probably least happy with this one . I use this splitter to split the headphone feed into two lines so that a student and I can both plug in to an amp with a single input . Not everyone knows that TRS jacks can be either mono or stereo jacks .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O5C","text":" The wiring is not only stiff but has extra strong memory (read: cable does not relax or straighten out) It's also too short to connect my headphones to the rear of my headphone amp . The wiring has extra strength and is stiff, meaning cable doesn't relax .  The headphone jack is very loose and any movement causes intermittent sound .  Hardly ever use it. Hardly use it .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O5H","text":" This unit only CUEs and OUTPUT MONO AUDIO is not the product you are looking for . Also works for the advertised purpose, to split a stereo source into two mono channels . Splits left and right audio, to make two mono speakers into a stereo setup .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068O6B","text":" It's not extra sexy-looking, extra bulky, or anything like this, it works as advertised, thank you! I wanted to hook up my old stereo headphones with a 1\/4&#34; plug to my desktop computer . I had lost my adapter for my sennheiser hd555 and had to buy a new one so this was the item i had to get .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068OA6","text":" Amazon?  Half that and it was a prime item with Prime item? The perfect cord arrived several days ahead of schedule and delivered promptly with prime . If you want to plug something other than a device with an IEC C10 connector on it, DON'T BUY IT .","product_category":"Electronics"},{"product_id":"B000068OAT","text":" The color coding system of these snakes makes sense to have in a dimly lit studio crammed in behind your racks . Shipped quickly and just as low noise as some $100 cables . If you are looking for D Sub cables that are good quality but don't cost an arm and a leg, this product is a must have .","product_category":"Electronics"}]
