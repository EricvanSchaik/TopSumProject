{"text":"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"}

{"text":"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\nThe hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\nThis suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\nThis argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\nNonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\n\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\nThey then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\n\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\" Mr Hsiung explained.\nGiven that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\".\nThe answer? \"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\"\nWhat is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\nThe team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\nThey used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \"structural colour\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\nThe results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\n\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\" Mr Hsiung said.\n\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\"\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n\"We don't know yet,\" Mr Hsiung said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter"}

He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were \"heavily damaged\".\nAlso on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.\nLufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of \"severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.\n``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.\nShe could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.\nThe final minutes\nLubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.\nLittle more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.\nWhat happened in the last 30 minutes of Flight 4U 9525?\nWho was Andreas Lubitz?"}
{"text":"Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.\nHe said there was often \"horseplay\" with colleagues, involving \"piggybacks, tickling and squeezing\".\nBut he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.\nMr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.\nHe joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \"hundreds\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\n\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\"\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \"full performance\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\nMr Caplan asked: \"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\"\nReferring to the \"horseplay\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\".\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\n\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\"\nHe added: \"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\"\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: \"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\"\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \"play-acting high jinks thing\", he said.\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \"many times\", but agreed that out of context, the \"Benny Hill-style\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?\"\nMr Fox replied: \"I can't get in (her) head.\"\nMr Price continued: \"Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?\" to which the defendant replied: \"No.\"\nMr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.\n\"It never happened,\" he said, although he did acknowledge he \"could have easily taken her for a tour\".\nMr Fox agreed it would be \"quite wrong\" for an adult man to \"stick his tongue\" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.\nIf a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with \"a social kiss\" on the cheek, he said.\nThe girl in question had, he added, \"become a little bit obsessed with me\".\nAsked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: \"I don't have an explanation at all.\"\nMr Price said: \"Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?\"\nThe DJ replied: \"I can't explain those coincidences.\"\nThe trial continues."}

{"text":"He would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.\nNow in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.\nSewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.\nChristian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.\nBut what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.\nBecause of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.\nHowever, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July."}

A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK's interests.\"\nHe also said the \"cheerleaders\" for Brexit had shown a \"disregard that amounts to contempt\" towards those that backed the losing side.\nAnd he said the UK would become \"far more dependent\" on the US after it leaves the EU, describing President Donald Trump as \"less predictable, less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors\".\nSir John, who as prime minister between 1990 and 1997 oversaw the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, warned that \"uncertainties over border restrictions\" after Brexit were \"a serious threat to the UK, to the peace process and for Ireland, North and South\".\nThe ex-PM, who faced battles with Eurosceptic MPs during his time in Downing Street, also said Mrs May would have to \"face down\" people calling for \"total disengagement\" from Europe.\nBut the Leave Means Leave campaign hit back, recalling Sir John's famous \"don't bind my hands\" plea to Tory Eurosceptics ahead of EU talks and saying he was now \"seeking to do just this to the British prime minister ahead of negotiations with the EU\".\nConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: \"It was a craven and defeated speech of a bitter man who was heavily defeated by the electorate for his own failings in Europe in 1997, was defeated again last June and now wishes to take out his failures on Mrs May.\""}

The Commons vote is due at 19:00 GMT.\nThe House of Commons is debating the Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill, which would keep benefit rises to 1% for three years from next April.\nThe coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation.\nBut Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people.\nSome Lib Dem MPs, including David Ward, John Leech, Julian Huppert and former minister Sarah Teather, are expected to rebel against the government while others - including Julian Huppert - could abstain.\nMr Leech, MP for Manchester Withington, said he found it \"objectionable that the Tories are using 'skivers versus strivers' rhetoric to justify a cut to seven million working families\".\nDespite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote.\nLegislation is needed to implement changes announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's Autumn Statement - to cap increases in jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, income support and elements of housing benefit.\nThe cap would also apply to maternity allowance, sick pay, maternity pay and paternity pay as well as the couple and lone parent elements of the working tax credit and the child element of the child tax credit.\nThese benefits traditionally rise in line with consumer prices in an annual process known as \"uprating\".\nBy Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News\nGlance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent.\nFigures in the Autumn Statement show raising many benefits and tax credits by 1% a year will save \u00a32.8bn in 2015\/16, compared with the government's previous plans.\nThe overall welfare budget in 2011\/12, as calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is \u00a3201bn.\nThe political debate will centre on who should feel the pain.\nJobseekers Allowance totals 2.4% of the total bill, according to the IFS. Benefits for those on low incomes make up just under 21%.\nThose for elderly people, including the state pension, make up over 42%.\nThe estimated value of fraud and error overpayments in benefit expenditure in 2011-12 is \u00a33.2 billion.\nThey increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. The rate of inflation has since risen to 2.7%.\nDuring lively scenes in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said: \"The number one priority now is reducing the deficit that they [Labour] left us - the biggest deficit since the Second World War.\"\nHe added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had \"grown\" in the last few years.\n\"These are decisions that we are not taking easily but these are circumstances that they [Labour] are in denial about,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\nFor Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne accused the government of presiding over an increase in unemployment.\nBut Mr Duncan Smith said this was not the case and that the US and other European countries were faring worse than the UK.\nMr Byrne said the government was showing \"contempt\" by trying to \"ram this bill through the House in just one day\".\nHe added: \"It's turning into a hit-and-run on working families and we should not stand for it.\"\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas said: \"Isn't the truth of this that it's a mean and miserable piece of legislation from a mean and miserable government?\"\nSarah Teather, who was replaced as an education minister in last autumn's government reshuffle, said she would oppose the bill \"with a heavy heart\" because it was \"disingenuous\" to try to \"find someone to blame for our own woes\".\n\"A fissure already exists between the working and non-working poor,\" she told MPs. \"Hammering on that fault line with the language of 'shirkers and strivers' will have long-term impacts on public attitudes, on attitudes of one neighbour against another.\n\"It will make society less generous, less sympathetic, less able to co-operate.\"\nHowever, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: \"It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work.\"\nDavid Cameron's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister's view is that the welfare system has to be brought back under control. The measures that the government has been taking, ever since the government came to power, have been designed to that end.\"\nThe BBC's political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said an \"impact assessment\" published by the government suggested single parents would be most affected by the cap - losing \u00a35 a week or about \u00a3250 over the three year period.\nThe majority of working age households in receipt of state support are likely be an average of \u00a33 a week worse off."}

{"text":"Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay.\nThe introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo.\nIt was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season\nRead more of the blog\nJames Milner, another second-half substitute, added the second with two minutes left from David Silva's sublime pass to allow City to move top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester United's visit to Stoke City.\nAnd it was a win City deserved for demonstrating the patience and persistence they will need as Everton's dour approach is likely to be mirrored by plenty of sides who will attempt to suppress City's wide range of attacking options at Etihad Stadium.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEverton's tactics appeared designed to secure a draw and perhaps aim to take an isolated chance on the break.\nBut David Moyes' side were undermined by a failure to offer anything in attack, although substitute Louis Saha - and his manager - were rightly infuriated when referee Howard Webb failed to award a free-kick when he was blatantly fouled on the edge of the area by Vincent Kompany with the game still in the balance.\nMoyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in.\nMancini will relish the manner of this win as much as other victories earned in real style this season. Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.\nSergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.\nIt was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.\nBalotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.\nBalotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.\nSilva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.\nEverton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.\nLive text commentary"}
{"text":"Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs a target to reduce six week delays in discharging patients had been delivered.\nBut Labour said it had not been met for more than three years, and called for her to amend the record.\nMs Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past.\nDelayed discharge - sometimes referred to as bed blocking - is when a patient is not released from hospital despite being clinically well enough to be discharged, often because of a lack of care of care services.\nMs Sturgeon faced criticism over the issue during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, with Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale saying that people had remained in hospital for a total of 612,000 days last year when they were well enough to go home.\nShe said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to.\nMs Dugdale added: \"That means it has more than trebled under the SNP government since this first minister admitted there was something badly wrong. So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\n\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\"\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \"completely eradicate\" the problem.\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\"\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \"zero delays over six weeks\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\nRead more from Brian\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \"real progress\" was being made.\nShe later added: \"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\n\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\"\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\nDr Simpson added: \"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\n\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\n\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\"\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\n\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\n\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\""}

{"text":"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan."}

If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'\"\nAbout half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.\nThe Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.\nHe then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.\nThe Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.\nLike many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.\n\"He didn't make a lot of money,\" his father said. \"Most of his money went on rent and food.\n\"He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.\"\nHe said his son was happy in London.\nFriends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.\nG\u00e9sio C\u00e9sar D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.\n\"We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,\" he said.\nOn 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.\nThey believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.\nIt is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.\nUndercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.\nHe took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.\nPolice were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.\nIn the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.\nAlmost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.\nOn 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined \u00a3175,000 with \u00a3385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial.

{"text":"The title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China?\nChelsea gave their answer with an impressive 3-0 win at Leicester City that, combined with the weekend's other results, put them firmly back in control of their Premier League destiny.\nSo, after 21 games and another weekend of significant matches, how are the top six clubs shaping up?\nForm: Won 14 out of past 15.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Hull (home), 31 January - Liverpool (away), 4 February - Arsenal (home).\nConte will have demanded an instant Premier League response from his team after that 2-0 loss at White Hart Lane, which he rightly placed in context by pointing out it was inflicted by a quality side with title aspirations of their own.\nThe wildcard was provided by the sudden falling out with influential striker Costa that provided an unexpected backdrop to Saturday's events at the King Power Stadium and gave the first hint of dissent in Chelsea and Conte's camp this season.\nIn the end, the Italian boss was given the opportunity to prove the versatility and flexibility of his squad in Costa's absence as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro provided the attacking threat.\nIn the absence of any suggestion Blues owner Roman Abramovich will bow to pressure to sell in January, the priority now is to get the combustible Spain striker back on side and ensure any unrest does not spread.\nIf that can be done, then Chelsea can look back at a weekend where their title position was strengthened as they now stand seven points clear.\nVerdict: Back on track and clear title favourites.\nForm: Won past six.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Manchester City (away), 31 January - Sunderland (away), 4 February - Middlesbrough (home).\nMauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority.\nIt was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21.\nHarry Kane is firing on all cylinders, shown by his hat-trick against West Brom, and with Dele Alli scoring seven goals in his past five league games Spurs are starting to look the full package.\nThey ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly.\nThe Argentine will still hope to avoid injuries and there is a real worry over influential defender Jan Vertonghen, who Pochettino fears has suffered a \"bad\" ankle injury.\nNext weekend's game at Manchester City will tell us even more about them.\nVerdict: Flew under the radar for a while but now right at the heart of the title race.\nForm: One defeat in past 19.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Swansea (home), 31 January - Chelsea (home), 4 February - Hull (away).\nLiverpool will be disappointed they could not hold on for victory at Manchester United on Sunday, but there is plenty of encouragement to take from their performance.\nThe disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table.\nIt is to the Reds' credit that they came so close to victory despite key men such as Philippe Coutinho still not fit enough to start, Nathaniel Clyne out with a rib injury and Joel Matip sidelined because of confusion surrounding his absence from Cameroon's Africa Cup Of Nations squad.\nManager Jurgen Klopp rightly believes they are still in a strong position but will surely be frustrated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late goal means Chelsea stretched their advantage to seven points.\nVerdict: Remain title contenders but top four would still be fine achievement.\nForm: Unbeaten in past four.\nUpcoming fixtures: 22 January - Burnley (home), 31 January - Watford (home), 4 February - Chelsea (away).\nArsenal's win at Swansea City could not have been more convincing and they have responded well to successive losses at Everton and Manchester City, when they conceded winning positions and showed the vulnerability that has haunted them for seasons.\nEven at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far.\nAre they, however, potential Premier League winners? They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea.\nVerdict: In the mix as their manager demands, but will a soft centre let them down?\nForm: Two defeats in past three.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Tottenham (home), 1 February - West Ham (away), 5 February - Swansea (home).\nManager Pep Guardiola effectively wrote off Manchester City's title challenge after they were giving a thorough working over and beaten 4-0 at Everton.\nCity now face a fight to finish in the top four with a side seemingly physically weak, riddled with defensive frailty and a goalkeeper in Claudio Bravo who hardly ever seems to save a shot. Failure to make next season's Champions League would represent a catastrophe in the Spaniard's first season.\nAnd this is Guardiola's responsibility after he shipped out England keeper Joe Hart on loan to Torino. Out of the past 22 shots Bravo has faced, 14 have been goals.\nOnly five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games.\nThe problems are there for all to see, although Guardiola has so far done little to correct the faults.\nCity have suffered two damaging defeats on Merseyside in recent weeks - and do not look like a side who have the slightest chance of making up a 10-point deficit on Chelsea.\nVerdict: Forget the title. Manchester City are in a top-four fight now.\nForm: Unbeaten in past 12.\nUpcoming fixtures: 21 January - Stoke (away), 1 February - Hull (home), 5 February - Leicester (away).\nManchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title.\nThey could have closed to within two points of Liverpool with victory at Old Trafford on Sunday, but 12 points is surely an impossible gap to breach between United and Chelsea.\nUnited have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit.\nMourinho is definitely moving United forward, but not fast enough to make them title contenders this season.\nVerdict: Top four should be the target.

They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.\nThen there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.\nRecently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.\n\"Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,\" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.\nWhat do you think?"}

{"text":"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.\nThe diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.\nResearchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.\nThe study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.\nDiamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.\nA research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.\nThey noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.\nWhile ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\nHe said: \"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\n\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\"\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \"blue planet\" seems even more appropriate for Earth."}

{"text":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\nWill he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\n\"They give everything, these guys,\" he adds. \"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\""}

Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?\"\n\"They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.\n\"I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.\nHe acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said \"it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.\"\nThe creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.\nThe unit will also seek \"new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts\".\nThe Army spokesman said it would share the \"spirit of innovation\" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.\nChindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.\nThe new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.\nTony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: \"Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.\n\"I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.\"\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\nThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.\nThe brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of \"psyops\" - psychological operations.\nThey will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.\nCivilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.\nIt can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.\nPaul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a \"big expansion\" of the Army's psychological operations and was an \"attempt to rebrand and update\" this area of its work.\n\"We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,\" Prof Rogers explained.\nHe added: \"In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.\n\"We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.\"\nA former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build \"the Army for the future\".\n\"For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.\""}

{"text":"This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old.\nConservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks.\nThe research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International.\nThe Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild.\nHuman activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika.\nAfter the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds.\nDr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward.\n\"We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,\" he told BBC News.\nBut at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing.\nPiecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death.\nThese diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them.\nWWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: \"The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs.\n\"Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.\"\nDr Hilton added: \"What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum.\n\"The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.\"\nBut the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home.\n\"We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,\" said Dr Hilton.\n\"And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site.\n\"The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.\"\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"}

On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87.\nOn Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round.\nThe winners will earn \u00a312,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013.\n\"Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,\" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer.\n\"We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here.\n\"There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting.

Passion for the game was in them all.\nSporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved.\nIn 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League.\nDecisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games.\nSporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club.\nBut it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender.\nThey bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject.\n\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\" said Grewa.\n\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves.\n\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there.\n\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true.\n\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody.\n\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\"\nThe club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club.\n\"We want to get to the National League,\" said Grewa.\n\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that.\n\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally.\n\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\"\nAt 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop.\nBy any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team.\nThey do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup.\nSaturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15.\nThe players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments.\n\"I am a Manchester United fan,\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season.\n\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\"But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred.\n\"AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0.

The party also has 38 MSPs in Edinburgh's Holyrood parliament and they will seek re-election in 2016.\nIn her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had \"opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party\".\nShe added: \"In order that we can have the real discussion about how we take Scottish Labour forward, I believe it would be best if I took  myself out of the equation and stepped down as leader.\"\nShe described Labour's challenge in Scotland as \"serious\", but added \"I strongly believe that the Labour Party is not only our best chance of achieving a better, fairer Scotland, it's our only chance\".\nThere are two versions of this story.  In one version, Scottish Labour's departing leader, Johann Lamont, accuses her Westminster colleagues - and, by implication, Ed Miliband - of undermining her and failing to grasp how much Scotland has changed.  She says some of her MP colleagues are \"dinosaurs\".\nThe alternative version is that Johann Lamont wasn't up to the job - that she failed to counter the SNP, that she failed to modernise the party sufficiently to cope with a new Scotland where people are no longer prepared to back Labour as a duty, that she failed to attract new talent who might freshen up the party's portrait for the electorate in 2016, when Holyrood goes to the polls.\nReacting to news of the resignation, SNP deputy leader Nicola Sturgeon said that Ms Lamont \"carries my personal best wishes\".\nBut she added: \"There is no question that her shock resignation reveals Labour to be in complete meltdown in Scotland.\"\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see.\"\nThe timetable for choosing a new leader will be set out soon.\nIn the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood.\nWhoever replaces her will become Scottish Labour's seventh leader since the Scottish Parliament was established 15 years ago.\nMs Lamont, a former English teacher who joined the Labour Party as a teenager, has represented the Glasgow Pollok constituency at Holyrood since 1999.\nShe took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP.\nIn the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved \"significant credit\" for the successful \"No\" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign.\nHe added: \"She campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland making the case for social justice within the United Kingdom.\n\"She has led the Scottish Labour Party with determination. I know she will continue to serve her constituents.\n\"Having elected a new leader, I believe the party will show the same will and determination it did in the referendum campaign to help us to victory in the general election of 2015 and the Scottish elections of 2016.\"\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown has constantly been linked to the job, as has fellow MP Jim Murphy, who also played a prominent role in the referendum campaign.\nMr Brown said he was sorry to hear that Ms Lamont had resigned.\nHe added; \"She brought determination, compassion and a down-to-earth approach to the leadership and deserves great credit for taking on the challenge after 2011.\n\"I wish her well in the future.\"\nSenior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland.\nIf the two men refuse another scenario being canvassed is for a joint ticket between the MP Anas Sarwar and the MSP Kezia Dugdale.\nMr Sarwar would be the leader and would seek to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood.

Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.\nSome users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.\nAmerican actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.\nOthers renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).\nAmerican director Stanley Kubrick appeared to inspire people who posted about Fuel Metal Jacket, referring to Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket.\n2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. But Espace is also the name of minivan built by French car manufacturer Renault.\nPictures of people filling jerrycans at petrol stations led people to incorporate the term into film titles.

One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.\nArefin's crimes were  described as a \"clear case of modern day slavery\".\nAt Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.\nHe carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.\nThey were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a \"deposit\" in exchange for employment and a salary.\nOn their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.\nThe men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.\nArefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.\nIn one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.\nThe crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.\nResponding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: \"Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.\n\"Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.\"\nKevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: \"The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.\n\"This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial.

{"text":"French PM Manuel Valls and US Secretary of State John Kerry said civilians were dying in Russian air strikes.\nRussian PM Dmitry Medvedev said there was \"no evidence of our bombing civilians, even though everyone is accusing us of this\".\nOne observers' group says at least 1,015 civilians have been killed in Russian air strikes.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late last month that close to a quarter of those killed were under the age of 18.\nHow Putin is succeeding in Syria\nDisplaced Syrians struggle to survive\nSyria: The story of the conflict\nRussia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has consistently denied hitting civilian targets and insists it is battling terrorists.\nMr Valls said his government \"respects Russia and Russia's interests\" but \"that to re-discover the path to peace, to discussion, the Russian bombing of civilians has to stop\".\nMr Kerry again accused Russia of using so-called 'dumb bombs' in Syria that do not hit precise targets. Last week, he said women and children were being killed \"in large numbers\" by Russian raids.\nMr Medvedev said Russia was \"not trying to achieve some secret goals in Syria\", adding that \"we are trying to protect our national interests\".\nTheir comments were made at a security conference in Munich, days after world powers agreed a deal to push for a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week.\nAgreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved.\nUnder the plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria.\nThe halt will not apply to the battle against jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.\nThe tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. Now its chances of success look even slimmer - \"Forty-nine per cent,\" said Russia's foreign minister. \"Closer to zero,\" said his British counterpart.\nFor much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war.\nFrance, Britain and the US all accused Russia of targeting mainstream rebels and civilians with air strikes while leaving so-called Islamic State largely unscathed. Russia flatly denied this, saying most of those civilians were being besieged by rebels rather than by Assad's forces. Again, Western delegates disagreed.\nSo there are clearly two, diametrically opposed, versions of what is going on in Syria. That leaves little prospect of the concerted effort for peace by all parties that is so desperately needed.\nRebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government.\nThey also reiterated their demand that President Assad be removed from power. On Friday, the president said he wanted to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels.\nBut US state department spokesman Mark Toner said Mr Assad was \"deluded\" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.\nSyrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo.\nMore than 250,000 people have been killed and some 11 million displaced in almost five years of fighting in Syria.\nIn another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces.\nThe Kurdish fighters had seized territory from Islamists in recent days. Turkey views the Kurdish militia as allied to the PKK group, which has a waged a campaign against Turkish security forces for decades.\nOn Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State.\nSaudi Arabia is already part of the international coalition against IS.\nMr Cavusoglu also said it was possible that troops from his country and Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS forces. The US has so far ruled out a ground invasion.\nMoscow has warned against any new foreign ground intervention in the country, saying such a development could even lead to a world war.\nWhy is there a war in Syria?\nAnti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.\nWho is fighting whom?\nGovernment forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.\nHow has the world reacted?\nIran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."}

Some of them have worked, but some of them have been abysmal failures,\" he said.\n\"But I think they should be encouraged and applauded for looking at the situation. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management.\"\nHearn still owns Orient's Matchroom Stadium. But for that, he believes it could have been sold for redevelopment.\n\"Fortunately Leyton Orient have got a 20-year lease on the ground, with another 20-year option. I did it on purpose because I could never be 100% sure where I was selling,\" he added.\n\"I kept the ground to make sure it wasn't used for the wrong reasons - that it wasn't the wrong reasons for buying a football club. Thank goodness I kept it because I would imagine now, with the situation it is, developers would be knocking on the door tomorrow.\"\nWhen asked by BBC Sport, Leyton Orient declined to respond to Hearn's remarks or comment on Loft's proposals."}
{"text":"In the press release for the new record The Systems Are Failing, the musician writes: \"We're destroying the world, and we're still miserable. Fat, sick, stupid and anxious are no ways to live.\n\"These systems are failing. Let them fail. Change or die.\"\nWhat makes this different from a Moby album?\nI think a lot of people think of me as making sort of down-tempo quiet, electronic living room music and this record is much more of a fast, aggressive post-punk record and, based on the reactions I've had so far, people have been a little nonplussed at that.\nWhat reactions specifically? Do people think you're crazy or are they applauding a brave new direction?\nBoth in equal measure, part of what led me to want to make a record like this, is the awareness that people don't really buy records any more and people especially don't buy records from 51-year-old musicians who are making their 15th record, so with those two things in mind there's also a sense of emancipation that comes with that.\nYou can either bemoan the fact that, in 2016 the audience for albums is quite small, but I see it as being really liberating because there's no external pressure at all. I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting.\nYou've been very commercially successful and some might say that puts you in the privileged position of not having to worry about it.\nYes and it would be hard for me to argue that. I would feel absurdly presumptuous criticising anyone else's choices, there are a lot of musicians who have children or alimony payments or sick relatives, so they need to make commercial compromises in order to pay the rent. I'm lucky because I live a relatively simple life and I can make whatever music I want to make without any worry about any commercial ramifications.\nIn your mission statement for this project you state: 'When some of my middle-aged compatriots try to accommodate the pop market place, the results are so anodyne and depressing'. Did you have someone specific in mind?\nI did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But the truth is that a majority of musicians as they age don't do so in a graceful way. What I mean by that is, I understand that as you age, you want to hold on to your glory days and for most musicians that was decades ago, so you find yourself dressing the same way and touring and taking out your contact lenses so the audience will be blurry and look bigger than it is.  If I don't have to go down that route, I'd just as soon not.\nBut your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do?\nI have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit.\nI own a restaurant in LA and 100% of the profits goes to animal welfare charities and my only show this year is a fundraiser for an animal rights group. I don't mean that in a self-congratulatory way, I just mean my criteria has changed. How do my choices benefit the causes that I care about? So, if an advertiser came to me with a dump truck full of money to license a song, I would probably say \"yes\" and simply direct the dump truck to one of the organisations I work with.\nI've always tried to employ that ethos when it comes to advertising,  like \"rob from the rich and give to the poor\" or, more accurately, \"take from corporations and give to those who work against those corporations\". But even when I was being crucified for that, I really didn't want to talk about it because it seemed defensive. It made me uncomfortable trying to justify myself even if there was justification there.\nWith that and the Pacific Void manifesto, it sounds like you're having a conscientious mid-life crisis but, instead of buying a sports car, you're trying to right the world's wrongs.\nI've always been potentially an annoying, opinionated loudmouth. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. There's so much, especially in the public arena, of this shameless, endless self-promotion that it just makes me nauseous.\nI don't want to be like them, there are too many horrifying pressing issues. Just putting out a new fashion line or lending your name to a perfume company would be fine if the world wasn't an inch away from catastrophe.\nIs this your main creative drive now or will you go back to recording under Moby?\nI made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me.\nDo you intend on touring the new album?\nDear God no. It's another thing that's emancipating . Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. I love playing music but going to the same airports and the same hotels and the law of diminishing returns, as you age you play smaller venues and you try and play new songs but the audience just want to hear the hits which I understand because when I go to see middle-aged musicians, I want to see the hits.\nBut if I never ever go on tour again, I would be very happy.\nHave you said everything you need to with this album?\nI've already made the follow-up record, I'm just trying to figure out when my record label will let me release it. Part two is all ready to go but clearly record companies don't love middle-aged musicians who refuse to tour, so I can't be too haughty and high-handed with them. I have to rely on their good graces.\nThe debut album by Moby & The Void Pacific Choir is released 14 October 2016.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."}

Crucially, they are more likely to get into a leading Russell Group university, which is very good news.\n\"However that seems to come at the expense then in terms of their successes of degree outcomes.\n\"Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1.\"\nHe added: \"The number of students who are not likely to get a good degree isn't as significantly as large as we first thought.\"\nProf Taylor said the Welsh Bacc's success in terms of getting students into university \"far outweighs\" the disadvantages found in terms of their results.\nBut he said: \"We do make the recommendation that it could be more challenging. It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study.\n\"We also recognise there needs to be greater support for the qualification because it has some added value.\n\"There are clearly some benefits to some students in terms of essay writing skills, in terms of time management and independent learning that most other qualifications don't offer.\n\"But it doesn't translate in terms of degree results and that may be because it's at the expense of subject knowledge which is missing.\"\n\"On the one hand it's a core qualification that every student should undertake and it provides a set of core skills that everybody like employers, labour markets and higher education universities can understand is there but at the same time it's got to be challenging, got to be tailored to the individual needs of students.\n\"That challenge is very difficult for sixth forms and FE colleges.\"\nLast year, a study by the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) also suggested undergraduates completing the Welsh Bacc fare less well at university than those who have not.\nThe Welsh government said the research by Cardiff University was commissioned to help with the development of the Welsh Bacc.\nA spokesperson added: \"Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate.\n\"As a result, we are working towards delivering a more rigorous Welsh Baccalaureate to be taught from September 2015.\n\"This will provide further assurance to higher education institutions about the ability of Welsh Baccalaureate learners and will help university admissions tutors make offers to prospective learners.\""}

Some 11.5 million others - more than half of the country's population - have fled their homes.\nRebels have made numerous attempts to seize key installations held by the government, but with little effect.\nOn Thursday, 13 Islamist fighting groups and al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, came together to launch a co-ordinated assault on several fronts.\nA statement said the aim of the new coalition, called Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), was \"the liberation of Aleppo and its countryside\", after which they would work with other groups to govern the city according to Islamic law.\nWestern-backed groups also said they were taking part in the offensive, organised through a joint operations room called Fatah Halab (Conquest of Aleppo), the New York Times reported.\nThe rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported.\nThe offensive unleashed on government-held western Aleppo by Ansar al-Sharia seems to be the most serious since the battle for Aleppo began.\nAn early test of its prospects will be one of the first apparent objectives - the loathed and feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Zahra, on the western edge of the city. Rebels have tried many times to capture it, and failed.\nThe offensive has been building up for some time, following the capture of Idlib by a newly-coalesced rebel alliance, Jaish al-Fatah (Victory Army), in March.\nWhat's making the difference is that rebel groups, and their outside backers like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which were competing in the past, now seem to be pulling together - bad news for the regime.\nThe success of the new campaign may depend on whether Damascus is seriously determined to hang on to Aleppo. If it is, rebel progress will be slow and hard.\nThe UK-based group said the fighting continued into the early hours of Friday and was focused on the frontline in Zahra, a heavily-defended area that houses several major security compounds.\nAt least nine people were killed and dozens wounded by the rebel barrage, it added.\nThe military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours.\nOn Friday morning, military sources told Sana and Reuters news agency that the assault had been repelled and that heavy casualties had been inflicted on the rebels.\nThe Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance.\nThe BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government.\nThere have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.\nBut state media reported that the prime minister has just been in Aleppo, visiting front-line units and dispensing large amounts of cash to the city authorities for reconstruction and administrative expenses."}

These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.\nIts new \u00a31bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now.\nIt is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage.\nTwo have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas.\nThe upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors.\nInvestigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton.\nThe natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine.\nThe disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine.\nMeasures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again.\nThe Proton has had a torrid record of late.\nSix vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced.\n\"The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,\" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News.\nThe new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.\nGlobal Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.\nTraditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.\nThe higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.\n\"If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,\" said Mr Franci\n\"So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}

We are working on that but it is looking good.\"\nThe supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment\nAlonso qualified only fifth in Spain but fought through to win after moving up to third on the first lap and then using an aggressive four-stop strategy that allowed him to exploit the Ferrari's race pace.\nIt was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems.\nIn Malaysia, he damaged his front wing in a collision with Vettel on lap one and then retired when it broke after he did not come in to change it.\nIn Bahrain, he finished eighth after problems with his DRS overtaking aid.\nAlonso said: \"We have only had five races in the championship. In these five races, we have nearly two retirements and without this we were maybe leading now a little comfortably.\n\"So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket.\"\nAlonso had a scare when one of his tyres got a puncture before his final pit stop, but the team were able to bring him in two laps earlier than planned to avoid a problem.\n\"We decided to play safe after Malaysia, where we were a little bit brave trying to do one extra lap with the front wing broken and we crashed in that lap.\n\"Here it could have affected the strategy because it was stopping too early, but it was OK and didn't affect the result.\"\nThe victory was Alonso's third in his home country, following his 2006 Spanish Grand Prix win for Renault and last year's victory in the European Grand Prix in Valencia.\nHe was cheered by the packed grandstands and afterwards paid tribute to the fans, making a reference to the troubled economic situation in Spain as a result of the Eurozone crisis.\n\"It is fantastic,\" he said. \"Winning at home is always like you did it for the first time.

{"text":"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.\nBut what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?\nThe best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.\nImagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.\nThey symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.\nLower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.\nIn this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?"}

So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.\n\"They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.\"\nThe starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide.\nThat scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.\nShadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.\n\"After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership.\n\"Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.\"\nCampbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was \"absolutely vital\" that the homes built were \"genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes\".\n\"There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,\" he said.\nGrainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed \"the focus on supply and affordability\" but still had \"some serious concerns\".\nShe said: \"This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another.\n\"Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too.\n\"Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.\"\nUnder the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use.\nSavings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said.\nPublic sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge.\nThe homes would be exempt \"from a raft of taxes\", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.\nSome building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.\nThe zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency.\nIt requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes."}

There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list."}

I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.\"\nThe world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were \"pathetic\".\n\"Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,\" he said.\n\"My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that.

So it's good.\n\"I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it. I think you need to know where you are at.\"\nStreb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62.\nThe 29-year-old, who missed the cut at each of the first three majors of 2016, said he turned up this week \"just to see if I could play some good golf and have fun\".\nHe added: \"Obviously it's going pretty well, but my expectations are pretty low, which maybe is a good thing.\"\nDay was Friday's other big mover, knocking in seven birdies in eight holes from the eighth to sit two off the lead.\n\"I kind of gave myself a little bit of a kick up the bum with the double bogey on seven,\" he said.\n\"It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine.\"\nFormer world number one and two-time major winner Spieth had five birdies in his opening nine holes to get to four under par but missed several opportunities to better his score on his back nine, while a bogey saw him close on three under.\n\"It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention,\" said the American. \"I'm hitting the ball fantastic.

{"text":"David Anderson QC said his \"central concern\" about the proposals first unveiled by David Cameron in early September was: \"Where are the courts?\"\nTemporary Exclusion Orders are one of the measures in the counter terrorism bill published by Theresa May.\nIt also includes tougher powers to stop people going abroad to fight.\nIt will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country.\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\nAnalysis by Political Correspondent Robin Brant\nThe government proposes the law, parliament passes it, then David Anderson reviews it - and sometimes makes recommendations. That's the usual sequence of events.\nBut today the independent reviewer was criticising the process before the new Counter-Terror and Security Bill was published.\nThe QC used his customary polite, sometimes understated, tone - but this was a criticism of politicians whom he said hadn't fully thought through some of the proposals announced in early September.\nRead more from Robin\nMrs May's new measures to tackle terrorism come days after she said the UK faces a \"greater\" terror threat than ever before.\nThe measures include requiring airlines to pass on details of their passengers and changes to the way TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - work to monitor terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted.\nBut campaigners have condemned it, saying it threatens civil liberties.\n'A more sensible way'\nMr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was \"nothing like as dramatic\" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year.\nHe told the Joint Committee on Human Rights the original plan to block suspected British jihadists returning from Iraq and Syria as \"an announcement waiting for a policy\".\nBut he said it soon became clear such a move would \"neither legally or practically\" work and the current plan was now much \"closer to managed return\".\nHe argued there could be \"a more sensible\" way of dealing with some people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.\n\"One could look at it in terms of young, possibly vulnerable people caught up with the wrong crowd in Syria - didn't really know exactly what they were doing,\" he said.\n\"Do you want to throw the book at them straight away in terms of arrest and charge? Or is there something to be said, even though you do suspect them of having fought, of keeping them under a very light regime where they might have to report daily to a police station?\nThe new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill includes:\n\"They might have to notify their residence; they might have to go along to meetings with probation or with some similar which perhaps might be for some people be a more sensible way of dealing with them than putting them straight into the criminal justice process.\"\nMr Anderson said the use of exclusion orders would require the cooperation of carriers, such as airlines and of states where these people might find themselves.\n\"But certainly presented with an order at the check-in desk, the person might say: 'I want to come home,' or decide not to come home,\" he said.\n\"The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this?\n\"If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so.\n\"One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes.\n\"If one is abroad when this order is served on you, then it's a little difficult to see in practical terms how a right to judicial review could be exercised.\"\nMr Anderson spoke out as a week-long counter-terrorism awareness campaign enters its third day.\n'Changing threats'\nThe UK's terror threat level remains \"severe\" after it was upped from \"substantial\" earlier this year in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria.\nSpeaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: \"We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.\n\"This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves.\"\nThe government wants to \"fast-track\" the bill through Parliament, citing the need to tackle the direct threat posed by the group calling itself Islamic State (IS) and the increasing number of Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to fight on its behalf.\nBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said more was needed to be done to stop British citizens from being radicalised and to deal with any threat this posed to national security.\nAmnesty International called the powers \"draconian\", adding none of the measures seemed \"properly thought through\".\nAnd Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: \"Yet again, politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.\"\nThe Home Office says communications data has played a major role in \"every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade\" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled.\nMrs May has warned that even the new data retention powers will not fully address the threat, reiterating the need for a Communications Data Bill to bring in more wide-ranging web monitoring powers.\nThat bill - labelled a snooper's charter by critics - was scrapped following Lib Dem opposition.\nTechnology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device.\nThe Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been \"a distinct lack of engagement\" with the industry.\nMinisters want to amend legislation passed earlier this year to require firms to retain data, including that \"required to identify the sender or recipient of a communication, the time or duration of a communication, the type, method or pattern of communication and the telecommunications system used\".\nHowever, the bill stresses that the content of messages and details that would \"explicitly identify\" what websites someone had visited would not have to be stored.\nOn Tuesday a report into last year's killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby raised questions about whether social network providers should have to report details of extremist activity.\nDavid Cameron said companies had a \"social responsibility\" to act on terrorist material posted online after the report detailed how Michael Adebowale, one of two men convicted of Mr Rigby's murder, spoke on Facebook about wanting to murder a soldier.\nFacebook said it did not allow terrorist content and aimed to stop it."}

It's a place you just really want to go.\nThat message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar.\nFor a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity.\nSingapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension.\nThe track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop.\nAs the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place.\nFor those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too.\nKnow someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.\nFirst track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning.\nYou can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place.\nOh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own.\nA long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close.\nAdd it all up and it's a race not to be missed.\nAndrew Benson, chief F1 writer\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox."}
{"text":"Neill Birnie is paralysed from the neck down as a result of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\nIn 2014, he was admitted to Antrim Area Hospital three times.\nHe said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file.\nAccording to Mr Birnie, the order had been placed on his record without his knowledge.\nThe 48-year-old is unable to talk and spoke to me via a head-operated computer.\n\"A consultant told me that I had gone through enough and I had to face the facts.\n\"He went on to say that he'd consulted with others and that they both thought that a DNR notice should be placed on my admission file,\" said Mr Birnie.\nHe told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed.\n\"What some of the doctors did was life-threatening and mentally cruel. I felt I had been tossed to the one side, I had no feelings of self worth,\" added Mr Birnie.\nSeveral months after the incident, Mr Birnie made an official complaint to the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.\nIn a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister.\nThe trust also said that if the infection had caused his heart to stop, medical staff would not have been able to bring him back and that attempts at cardio respiratory resuscitation would not have been in his best interests.\nHowever, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent.\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.\n\"The decision to implement a DNR is a medical one, which is taken in cases where medical professionals feel that if a person's medical condition at that time causes their heart to stop, resuscitation attempts would be futile and therefore not in their best interests in providing a dignified death.\n\"This was discussed with Mr Birnie initially and was put in place following a conversation with his next of kin who indicated that they had talked it over with Mr Birnie and agreed with the decision taken,\" the statement said.\n\"A DNR notice is reviewed and, if felt appropriate, renewed on a daily basis. There is currently no DNR on Mr Birnie's file and his treatment remains unaffected.\"\nA DNR notice is an extremely sensitive issue. Often the subject can arise when a person least expects it or is not in a position to make a rational judgement.\nThe order means medical staff will not attempt to bring the patient back to life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.\nThe decision to use one is ultimately a doctor's, but official guidelines from the British Medical Association (BMA) state medical staff have a duty to discuss it with relatives wherever possible.\nThe problem for medical staff is that sometimes the conversation between doctor and the patient or family may not take place in time.\nThe usual circumstances in which it is appropriate not to resuscitate are when it will not restart the heart or breathing; when there is no benefit to the patient; and when the benefits are outweighed by the burdens.\nThe guidelines also say that it should only be issued after discussions with the patient or family.\nHowever, according to Neill Birnie that did not happen.\nAs a quadriplegic who requires 24-hour care via the computer, he told me he is still a human being with feelings: \"The lights are still on and I am definitely at home.\"\nVia his voice-activated computer, he told a rude joke that made me laugh. He smiled through his eyes.\nAt times, there were tears in his eyes.\nEarlier this year, a study by the Royal College of Physicians in England found one in five families was not consulted when doctors had decided not to revive their relative.\nThe study was taken from just over 9,000 dying patients."}

He insists the Russian claim of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian special forces was cooked up by the Kremlin to justify future attacks.\nHowever little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea.\nOne man from the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa said he went there only to visit his elderly mother who lived there and wouldn't leave.\nWhen she dies, he will not travel there any more.\nFor Igor, travelling to Crimea to visit relatives, the latest rhetoric is \"mostly exaggerated\".\n\"Whatever you see on TV, (with) saboteur groups arrested, I think this can be faked by any side. Each side can create provocations.\"\nWith his tennis racket bag slung over his shoulder, Artyom, a Ukrainian probably in his 20s, explains how pleasant his holiday in Crimea has been, and how friendly the people there were.

However, she does not trust the Russian version of recent events.\n\"I think [the Russians] did this intentionally. But I don't know why they did this during the holiday season. Everything was fine when I came here in June with my mum.\"\nTamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev.\nAcross the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle.\nFew seem to notice the Ukrainian National Border Guard soldiers high above in their concrete look-out post at the back of the beach, behind an invisible network of trenches.\nFor all the political rhetoric of recent days, the fun-loving normality of the summer season in southern Ukraine goes on."}

{"text":"In a Commons debate, the ex-Labour leader said Conservative plans to limit the voting powers of Scottish MPs on Commons laws would \"rip up\" hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure.\nThe SNP said the Conservatives wanted to create a \"quasi-English Parliament\".\nBut ministers said it was vital England was treated fairly as further powers were devolved to other parts of the UK.\nAt the end of the debate, Labour staged and won a vote in which the government abstained. And Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order to urge the government to allow more time for the matter to be considered.\nThe government believes bills applying exclusively to England should not become law without the explicit consent of MPs from English constituencies and it wants to change Commons rules known as standing orders to give them a \"decisive say\" during their passage.\nMinisters say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.\nMark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent\nPanic stations? From the point of view of the government whips this afternoon's emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws was really rather alarming.\nThe debate, so skilfully secured by Lib Dem ex Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael, produced a slightly pointless vote in which the Conservatives mostly abstained, but it brought all kinds of nasty tensions to the surface.\nConservative MPs are supposed to be signed up for EVEL under the terms of their manifesto, but there were clearly quite a few with doubts, some about the policy, many more about the process, which was Mr Carmichael's line of attack.\nRead the article in full\nHowever, the plans came under sustained attack from Labour, SNP and Lib Dems in an urgent debate, secured by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.\nMPs are due to debate and vote on the government's plans next week but Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the plans required more detailed consideration, arguably through primary legislation.\nIf MPs representing constituencies in England had a \"veto\" on certain legislation, it would breach the longstanding principle that MPs, no matter who they represented, were \"all equal\".\n\"To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible,\" he said.\n\"They are not entitled to use the UK Parliament as a proxy for an English Parliament.\"\nAssurances that the new system would be reviewed by MPs after a year were inadequate, he added, saying this would not be capable of \"putting a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out - we all know that is the political reality\".\nBut Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was \"simply incorrect\" to claim some MPs would be prevented from debating and voting on certain legislation and would continue to exercise the same rights as they do now.\nPressed by Mr Miliband on \"what the meaning and definition\" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a \"simple test\" would be what things were devolved to Scotland.\nRequiring bills to have the support of a \"double majority\" of the whole of the Commons and those MPs representing England would also help mitigate \"any resentment\" felt by English voters about the slower pace of devolution to England.\n\"It is of vital importance that English citizens of the UK, as we move to an extra layer of devolution to Scotland and Wales and devolve additional tax powers to Northern Ireland, that they think it is fair,\" he said.\n\"It is what we pledged to do in our manifesto. We set it out in detail, step by step by step. We are implementing these changes and keeping our promises. I think the people who elected us would expect nothing else.\"\nMr Miliband said the Conservatives had the power to address the issue after winning the election but urged them to think again.\n\"Is this true to the traditions of Conservatism? No because the last thing you do is rip up hundreds of years of constitutional practice in a standing order vote just before the House goes into recess,\" he said.\n\"Doing this procedure in the way it is being proposed is an act of constitutional vandalism. It really is.\"\nThe SNP said Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through the Barnett Formula used to allocate public spending to different nations of the UK.\n\"This not just English votes for English laws, this is English votes for Scottish laws,\" said Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire. \"It is totally and utterly unacceptable.\"\nHe added: \"Why don't they just tattoo our foreheads 'Scottish' and then they would be able to identify us.\"\nAnd Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh said the move would not make any difference to the outcome of votes and urged ministers to omit laws which indirectly applied to Scotland, saying not to do so would be a \"gift\" to the SNP's independence campaign.\nResponding to a question by an SNP MP on Monday, Mr Grayling said the only English-only measure during the last Parliament had been the Education Bill, and there were 13 Bills which applied to England and Wales."}

They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground.\nBut the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual.\nAll hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance.\nTheir songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring.\nSo the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species.\nThey have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films.\nDr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy.\n\"It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged.\n\"Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy.\n\"And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons.\"\nThe researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.\nThe team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction.\n\"The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species,\" said Dr Turvey.\nIn response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter."}

{"text":"Regardless of the horse race that sprung from Lord Derby calling it right and winning that toss at Epsom in 1779, defeat would have had a much wider significance.\nThe event and its name are believed to be the root of the expression 'derby match', and it's worth considering that the loser was Sir Charles Bunbury.\nYou'll agree the 'Merseyside Bunbury' or the 'North London Bunbury' hardly have the same ring.\nMore than two centuries on from that coin toss to decide whose name the race should take, trainer John Gosden - who is due to have five runners in the 238th Derby, including big fancy Cracksman - marvels at what was created.\n\"It's a unique track,\" he says, staring out over the course as it snakes its way up, down and around the Surrey Downs barely 15 miles south west of central London.\n\"Obviously Bunbury and Derby had had a very good lunch when they came up here and pegged it out and flipped a coin.\n\"It's a very demanding track. You have to stay, you have to have great dexterity, agility, balance and a turn of foot comes in very handy.\n\"It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is.\"\nGosden, whose ever-powerful string based at Newmarket is the biggest threat to the prevailing dominance of Ireland's Aidan O'Brien, should know.\nIt's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer.\nGolden Horn, who by that point had won the regularly significant Dante Stakes at York, went on to stamp his authority on proceedings that season.\nAfter Epsom, he galloped off with the Eclipse Stakes, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before suffering one of just two defeats, at the Breeders' Cup fixture in Kentucky.\nCracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian.\n\"Cracksman is not a Golden Horn,\" Gosden told BBC Sport, \"but he's a superior horse to Benny The Dip.\n\"He's still learning a lot, and when he came here and won the trial he grew up overnight, so we're excited.\"\nBelieving there is no standout in this year's Derby, worth a total of nearly \u00a31.625m - a record, Gosden fields three more runners than ever before.\nCracksman, who like fellow leading contender Eminent is a son of champion racehorse-turned-fledgling stallion Frankel, is joined by striking Goodwood winner Khalidi - added as a late entry, for \u00a385,000 - plus three longer shots in Crowned Eagle, Glencadam Glory and Pealer.\nA multitude of runners under a single, or near-single, banner is something of a feature of the 2017 staging of the world's best-known flat racing prize.\nO'Brien - looking for a sixth win after Galileo, High Chaparral, Camelot, Ruler Of The World and Australia - saddles another formidable Coolmore-owned challenge.\nCliffs Of Moher, winner of the Dee Stakes at Chester, with Ryan Moore riding, leads six, ahead of well-supported Capri and Venice Beach. Douglas Macarthur, The Anvil - on which the trainer's apprentice jockey daughter Ana becomes the third female jockey to take part - and Wings Of Eagle make up the raiding party.\nO'Brien's son Joseph, the jockey on board when Camelot and Australia were victorious but now training, saddles Rekindling.\nVia his Godolphin operation and his son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, owner Sheikh Mohammed is represented by Permian, Lingfield Trial winner Best Solution, once-raced Dubai Thunder and Benbatl, the Dante Stakes runner-up.\nStrongly supported Eminent, sixth in the 2000 Guineas, trained by Martyn Meade and the mount of flat racing's champion jockey Jim Crowley, heads 'the rest'.\nIt does look genuinely wide open.\n\"We don't have any exceptional favourite standing out and frightening everyone away,\" said Gosden, whose father 'Towser' trained 1966 winner Charlottown as a two-year-old before ill health forced his own retirement.\n\"That's why we're winding up with a pretty big field. But I still think that the first three will be very, very good horses.\n\"The biggest problem is probably going to be for the jockeys getting around in a big field. You try riding around Epsom with so many other runners. It's not an easy job at all.\"\nFood for thought for apprentice jockey Paddy Pilley, who replaces Gina Mangan - barred from taking part on safety grounds - on 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia.\nHowever, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative.\nIt'll take a lot more than a spin of a coin to sort out this one."}

Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.\nTwo Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned.\nAnother shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw.\nMr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"There was no need for anyone to resign at this stage.

It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment.\nThe new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes.\nHuman rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent.\nAzriana, the head of the NCW, said: \"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\"\nDr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \"praying\" that the punishments \"will have the desired effect\".\nShe said: \"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.\"\nThe punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten.\nAnd earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed."}

And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million.\nThis year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals.\nBan Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: \"The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic.\n\"Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.\"\nThe report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to \"sprint\" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030."}

{"text":"And, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.\nThe first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones.\n\"I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party.\"\nSo will he vote for Hillary Clinton? \"I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her.\"\nI heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.\nAs jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time.\n\"When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington.\"\nSo, is Mr Trump the man to do that?\n\"I don't know,\" he says, \"but I'm voting for him.\"\nWatching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them.\n\"I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct.\"\nCrossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her \"girls\" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican.\n\"I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change.\"\nShe says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. \"I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up.\"\nShe expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.\nAn hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.\nBut the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party.\n\"Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons.\n\"His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic.\"\nBut, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.\nAnd that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.\nWhile disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her."}

{"text":"The play, written by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.\nIt opens officially at the Palace Theatre, in London's West End, on Saturday.\nAudiences have been urged to \"keep the secrets\" since the play began previews in early June.\nPresented in two parts, the play - showing the stars of the wizarding saga as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to school - stretches over five hours.\nDaily Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish awarded the play five stars, writing: \"British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days.\"\nHe said \"those involved can give themselves a pat on the back\", adding: \"It's a triumph. Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.\"\nCavendish praises the \"thrill-a-minute\" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms \"in the blink of an eye\" as they head to the infamous Platform 9\u00c2\u00be to make their way to school.\nThe Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a \"truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour\".\nIt is an \"entirely original\" piece of work, with \"Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling\", writes Shenton, adding: \"It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.\n\"By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.\"\nShenton also praises \"the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another\".\nIn a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the \"wizardry on display\" is \"out of this world\".\nShe says the plot is complex (\"there are mazes that are more straightforward\") but adds: \"It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart. Crucially, it's authentic Potter but, most importantly, it's new.\n\"It's not the movie of the book. It's the real deal, live in front of you, so much better than any film could be.\"\nIn The Guardian, Michael Billington noted the Cursed Child will make more sense to \"hardened Potterheads\", but applauded Tiffany for directing a \"thrilling theatrical spectacle\", giving it four stars.\nHe praised the strong performances that meant acting was central to the story, despite the dazzling special effects, singling out Sam Clemmett as Harry's son Albus, \"wonderfully quirky\" Anthony Boyle as his friend Scorpius Malfoy, and the adult Harry (Jamie Parker), \"authoritative\" Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) and \"bluntly commonsensical\" Ron (Paul Thornley).\nIt's another five stars from The Independent, with Jack Shepherd describing it as \"magical\". He argues Part One should be billed as a magic show, due to the effects used, also praising its moments of comedy.\nShepherd adds: \"It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze.\"\nQuentin Letts grumbles about the length of the play in the Daily Mail, noting: \"There were moments I could have done with a glug of gurdyroot infusion to keep me alert.\"\nBut he admits: \"Potter addicts will love it. JK Rowling is going to make (another) fortune. The West End's ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years.\"\nVariety describes it as \"spellbinding\", Matt Trueman writing that it is: \"The Show That Lived Up to Expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and Then Some.\"\nHe says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is \"the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing\", adding: \"The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts.\n\"No one's born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out.\"\nChris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that \"heretical as this may sound\", the play left him \"quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made\".\nBen Brantley in the New York Times writes: \"Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence.\n\"By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up. But like Ms Rowling's books, the play vanquishes resistance.\"\nThe Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films.\nThe script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."}

The city was immediately flattened.\n80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.\nEven then, Japan didn't surrender.\nThree days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.\nShortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.\nWorld War Two was over.\nWhen the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.\nThe blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.\nThere were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.\nThousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.\nBut the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.\nThe nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.\nThousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.\nJapan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).\nThe allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.\nHowever fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.\nJapan had been at war for many years.\nIt had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.\nEverywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.\nThey treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.\nUS President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.\nThe atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.\nPresident Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.\nUS President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.\nThere were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.\nSome historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.\nAmerica and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.\nIt was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.\nAlthough the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.\nThe way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.\nMany people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.\nToday, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.\nSome campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.\nOthers say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used."}

Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?\nShowing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.\nSo you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.\nBut this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.\nOxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.\nHe described Brexit for universities as the \"Manchester United problem\".\nWhy would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?\nThere were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.\nThe UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than \u00c2\u00a32bn into the higher education sector.\nThis is no small-bi\u00c3\u00a8re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.\nIf the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some \"serious funding\".\nProfessor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.\nBut could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?\nIf EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.\nBut such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.\nProf Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.\nWould they really be able to pay \u00c2\u00a317,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?\nCommittee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.\nBut what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?\nWhat will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?\nAnd of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.\nBut as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research.\""}

{"text":"The UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.\nIt is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.\nSince the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.\nThat is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.\nUS President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.\nIt was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.\nIt was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a \"new Middle East\".\nAhmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).\nViscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.\nHe found himself knocking on an open door.\nIf he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.\nThey were using him, and he was using them.\nWith the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.\nBut Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.\nBut it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.\nIn the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.\nThousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.\nIS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.\nNow it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.\nThat is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.\nDoing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling."}

The USAF lease the RAF bases.\nMr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force.\n\"I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.\"\nThe USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.\nRAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.\nThe Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.\nMatthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.\nMildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move \"will come as a shock to many\", he said.\n\"I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.\n\"We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.\"\nA UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review.\"\nRAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.\nIt has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.\nBoth bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.\nJames Waters, leader of the council, said: \"The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome.\n\"But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close.\n\"Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment.\"\nFor some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.\nIn part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.\nRAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.\nCurrently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.\nThe latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the \"kryptonite\" of modern air power.\nThey enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.\nIt is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.\nBritish defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.\nIndeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.\nOver recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.\nThe US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.\nToday about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.\nBut the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.\nRAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.\nThe USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.\nJason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was \"hugely disappointing\" as both bases contributed about \u00a340m a year to the local economy.\nHe said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: \"The impact on the local economy could be considerable.\n\"However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years.\""}

{"text":"His was not the only voice warning of the dangers of AI - Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak also expressed their concerns about where the technology was heading - though Professor Hawking's was the most apocalyptic vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us any more.\nWhat all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate.\nThat they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI.\nAnd Professor Hawking was there to help launch the centre. \"I'm glad someone was listening,\" he told the audience.\nIn a short speech, he outlined the potential and the pitfalls of the technology in his usual vivid language.  He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.\n\"I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and exceed it.\"\nThat, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.\n\"In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.\"\nSo, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.\nActually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.\nLong before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.\nAnother speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.\nShe told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.\nHer concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. \"I'm scared of that,\" she said.\nAfter decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.\nJust one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.\nRead more of the BBC's AI coverage here."}

Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.\n\"If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,\" she said.\n\"I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.\n\"For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.\nThe Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.\nIts mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen \"soon\", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.\nMs Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: \"We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.\n\"It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.\"\nMeanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.\nThe Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.\nBut the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.\nAt the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.\nAt the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.\nAverage waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.\nThe figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.\nNHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters\nAnd in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.\nPointing to a \"clear postcode lottery\" when it comes to treatment, he added: \"We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.\n\"There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.\"\nMs Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.\nShe added: \"However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.\n\"Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by \u00c2\u00a3150m of funding.\n\"We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.\""}

{"text":"Current drugs help manage the symptoms, but do not prevent brain cells dying.\nThe trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease.\nThe University College London (UCL) team is \"excited\", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing.\n\"There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,\" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC.\nIn Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost.\nIt leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems.\nTherapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse.\nNo drug stops that happening.\nIn the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication.\nAs expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable.\nAnd three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off.\nProf Foltynie told the BBC News website: \"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect.\n\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease.\n\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\"\nThey also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time.\nAn effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients.\nParkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \"trivial\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers.\nThe drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1.\nThose sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive.\nIt is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's.\nDavid Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - \u00e2\u20ac\u0160something no current treatment can do.\n\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\"\nDr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\""}

{"text":"After Brexit, that would obviously exclude London where the vast majority is currently done.\nThat has always been a major grievance for other European capitals who sense an opportunity to restart an old fight for a big prize.\nLondon's financial district - or \"The City\" - is like a coral reef. It has grown into a complex ecosystem over hundreds of years with lots of specialist organisms feeding off each other.\nThe coral is home to plants and anemones which in turn are home to fish, and crustacea of dazzling variety.\nBankers and traders may be the apex predators but there are lawyers, accountants, insurance brokers and tech workers swimming around them.\nIt's very hard to replicate but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. If you chip a bit off - you lose a few of the resident clownfish too.\nThat rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. It's a very basic, boring and yet incredibly important bit of the reef.\nClearing is the process by which a third party organisation acts as an intermediary for both buyer and seller.\nThey deal with the clearing \"house\" rather than each other which centralises everything and makes the whole complex business easier and quicker. 75% of all everything bought and sold in euros - anywhere in the world - is cleared in London - some 850 billion euros EVERY DAY.\nClearing houses also bear the risks that once side of the transaction doesn't cough up.\nIn return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. The more business you do with them, the less money proportionately of your trading volumes you need to keep in that account. Bigger clearing houses are therefore cheaper for their customers.\nIf you start chipping bits off the reef and carting them off to Europe those costs could rise. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them.\nIt would cost UK jobs too. An Ernst and Young study last year estimated that over 80,000 UK jobs would go if euro-clearing moved from London.\nOther financial centres have tried for years to steal this business. In fact, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt tried to insist that all euro trades in the EU were done inside the eurozone. A policy it had to scrap when the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 it discriminated against non-eurozone countries who are part of the EU.\nIf that court case is run again once the UK is outside the EU, that defence no longer works.\nThis new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups).\nIt's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU.

{"text":"Since 2005, he has worked from home on Wednesday mornings and then taken the rest of the day off.\nSimmons and Simmons offers flexible working to all staff and makes this clear in recruitment ads.\nIt is a stance employers' organisation the CBI wants other firms to emulate, arguing it will improve diversity.\nIn a report aimed at encouraging employers to hire a broader range of people from varied social backgrounds, age groups, races and gender the CBI suggests advertising flexible working at the outset.\nJust one in ten job adverts mention flexible working, despite more than half of employers offering it, meaning they miss out on a wider pool of applicants, according to the report.\nThe CBI also suggests that firms remove candidates' names from job applications in a bid to reduce \"unconscious bias\" in hiring decisions.\nThe organisation argues that firms with a broader pool of staff will perform better.\nCBI president Paul Drechsler says: \"Inclusive workplaces give firms the chance to get ahead of their competitors by making better decisions, through diverse teams which draw on a wider range of ideas and experiences.\"\nSince 2014, Simmons & Simmons has allowed almost all its staff to work remotely one day a week of their choice without having to request permission from their boss.\nIt says the move was aimed at making \"flexible working a right rather than an exception\" and has seen a \"significant increase\" in the number of people who have taken up flexible working.\nMr Taylor says in 2005 when he asked to work flexibly it was \"quite unusual\", but said he was granted permission in just three weeks. Being at home one day a week has enabled him to spend more time with his three children now aged 14, 12 and 9.\n\"At the time [when I asked] I was a relatively new partner and also a relatively new dad and had two young children and was worried i was not seeing a huge amount of them during the week.\"\nNow the children are older, he says he can pick them up from school as well as drop them off at activities. \"I haven't done anything particularly dramatic with the time, but it's nice to be there day-to-day and talk about what's going on at school.\"\nThe change has also enabled Mr Taylor's partner to work later on a Wednesday, helping her progress at work, as well as make him feel loyal to the firm.\nIt is these sorts of factors that the CBI wants companies to be aware of. Mr Drechsler argues that flexible working should no longer be seen as \"a bonus for staff\", but instead as something that also has clear benefits for employers.\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nThe report said data from earlier this month showing the UK's productivity still lags well behind other major economies meant employing a broader range of people was now more crucial than ever, and would help create more engaged employees.\n\"The economic and social challenges that the UK faces have been thrown into sharp relief by Brexit, in particular around issues like productivity, inclusion and opportunity,\" Mr Drechsler says.\n\"As businesses, it is up to us to seize the opportunities that exist to make some positive changes, becoming firms that will be competitive into the middle of the 21st century. If we get it right, business growth and greater opportunity will go hand in hand.\""}
{"text":"A proposed scheme would have scrapped upfront relief, worth an estimated \u00a321bn to savers, but made pension pot withdrawals tax free.\nAn alternative option was to set a flat rate of tax relief, which may have been unpopular with higher earners.\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Osborne was \"yet again ducking a big decision\".\nCampaigners said he had missed a \"huge opportunity\" to tackle pension inequality and help the lower paid.\nBut others said he was right to protect existing reliefs, and that radical reforms would have created new risks and imposed new administrative burdens on employers.\nMr Osborne had been expected to unveil changes in the Budget on 16 March, but a Treasury source said it was \"not the right time\" to make changes to pension tax relief.\nThe relief allows some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax to go into their pension instead.\nUnder the current system, pension savers receive tax relief at the same rate as their income tax - meaning basic rate taxpayers receive relief at 20% and higher rate taxpayers at 40 or 45%.\nThe proposal to introduce arrangements similar to an Isa, with no tax relief on contributions but with withdrawals free of tax, would have given a significant short-term boost to the government at the expense of lower tax revenue later.\nAn alternative option considered by the Treasury was for flat rate relief, which would have benefited basic rate taxpayers and cut reliefs for higher earners.\nBBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nSo a policy which hadn't been announced will now not be announced.\nAnd the big winners of this non-announcement will be wealthy people. At the moment not only do they earn more, they also get a proportionately bigger tax top-up from the government when they save for their retirement.\nIf the chancellor had scrapped the tax relief entirely on pensions savings and created instead a new pensions Isa, that would have cost the better off (40p and 45p taxpayers) billions of pounds collectively.\nThe other proposal which had been reported was to create a new pension tax relief rate of 25p or even 33p. That would have punished higher earners as well but not by as much as the Isa-style option.\nIt would also have encouraged saving for retirement by the less well off (20p taxpayers) by, in effect, giving a pound for every four they saved.\nMick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"very disappointed\" that the government had stepped away from tackling the \"clear inequality in our pension system\".\nDot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, Britain's biggest pensioner organisation, said: \"The chancellor has wasted a golden opportunity to not only reform the unfair system of pension tax relief, but at the same time solve the funding crisis in social care.\"\nConservative MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, acknowledged that the present system \"massively favours those people who are earning more money\" and told Today he favoured \"a fundamental rehash of the pension system\".\nHowever, he said a flat rate relief would have been \"quite difficult to administer\" and more thought should be given to what reforms would work best.\nMr McDonnell said the chancellor was \"putting the interests of his party ahead of those of our country\".\n\"The big test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the secure foundations for the economy of the future. This decision suggests George Osborne is only interested in securing the future leadership of his party.\"\nFormer Liberal Democrat pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works in the pensions industry, said Mr Osborne had been right to resist changes.\nHe called for a \"period of stability\" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term.\nSavers pay no tax on money they put into a pension but they do pay tax on what they take out each year beyond the personal allowance.\nThe government also allows pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pot tax free as a lump sum.\nThe way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead.\nPension savers receive tax relief at the highest rate of income tax they pay.\nThis means that the cost of a \u00a310,000 pension contribution would, in effect, be \u00a38,000 for a basic rate taxpayer because otherwise \u00a32,000 would have gone in tax. For a 40% taxpayer the saving would be \u00a34,000, and \u00a34,500 for those at the 45% rate. So present arrangements favour the better off.\nThe amount anyone can save into a pension and receive tax relief on is capped at \u00a340,000 annually and \u00a31.25m in their lifetime.\nMr Osborne was warned ahead of the Budget that introducing Isa-style arrangements could prompt a mass withdrawal from pension funds.\nConservative MPs had also become concerned about the impact on their constituents of any move to flat rate relief, which would have reduced breaks for higher rate taxpayers.\nBBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said Mr Osborne's decision was also a recognition of how fragile the EU referendum campaign is and removed the risk of upsetting voters ahead of the vote on 23 June.\nAn ally of the chancellor told the Times that Mr Osborne did not want to put people off saving. \"Now isn't the right time, with uncertainty in the global economy and reforms such as auto-enrolment still bedding in, to turn things on their head.\nThe prospect of radical reform had also been opposed by the pensions industry.\nChanges to the pensions system in recent years have included automatic enrolment into workplace pensions in 2012, and people aged 55 and over being allowed to take their retirement pots how they want rather than being required to buy an annuity retirement income - introduced in 2015."}

{"text":"Last year the authorities learned of 946 victims, compared with 710 in 2010, the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking said.\nTrafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe now pose the biggest threat to the UK , it said.\nThe government said better co-ordination between its departments and with authorities abroad was key.\nBut anti-slavery groups warned government \"failures\" had led to \"significant steps back\" in the fight.\nBy Tom SymondsHome Affairs correspondent\nIn Ilford, East London, the police moved in at 05:15 BST, smashing through the door of an end of terrace house, but without result. It was empty.\nThe Met says it carries out two such raids every week, on average.\nTwo miles away in a second house, they found a Lithuanian family living in one room. A stack of mail showed that a large number of people have stayed there before.\nThey questioned the Lithuanians who said they were being paid below minimum wage to work in a recycling depot and building firm.\nThe room costs \u00c2\u00a3140 a week. There was a CCTV camera watching the door of the house.\nAre they victims of people trafficking? It's not clear, and often those involved haven't asked themselves the same question.\nBut police say those who try to run are often subject to violence.\nThere is currently no official figure for the number of victims trafficked into the country each year.\nHowever, the report said 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism, the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking.\nOf the victims referred in 2010, 524 were adults and 186 were children.\nIt is thought the increase could be explained by improvements in identifying victims, although campaigners say the figures of those being trafficked could be far higher as many victims choose not to come forward for fear of being deported.\nThe report suggested an increase in the number of children being forced into crime, including street begging.\nThe Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre estimates there are about 300 child trafficking victims in the UK every year.\nThe report also detailed two cases of people trafficked for illegal organ removals, but they were detected and stopped before the operations were carried out.\nOne involved the planned sale of a victim's kidneys.\nDet Insp Kevin Hyland, of London's Metropolitan Police - which sees the UK's highest rates of trafficking - said some victims travelled to the UK in lorries or containers but the majority arrived lawfully, often accompanied by their traffickers.\n\"The vast majority of them think they're coming to a better life in the UK,\" he said.\nMr Hyland said it was often \"almost impossible\" for border guards to spot victims because they often did not even know they were being trafficked.\nMany victims are promised jobs in the hotel or leisure industry, or as interpreters, but when they arrive they are \"groomed or threatened\" and used for sexual exploitation, forced labour or both, he said.\nIn London, police deal with more than 100 cases of trafficking a year. Some will involve more than 400 victims but the majority involve about 10 to 15 people.\nThe report revealed the largest number of referrals of potential victims of trafficking were Nigerian nationals. From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.\nThere are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.\nAnd 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011\/12.\nBy Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News\nThe two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.\nBut it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.\nCases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.\nThe Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.\nThese cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.\nThe HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.\nThe process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.\nOnly when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.\nAdvice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.\nThe report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already \"proving effective\".\nImmigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at \"spotting\" the crime due to \"cross-government\" cooperation.\n\"We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBut the number of those prosecuted was \"not enough,\" he said.\n\"One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.\"\nMr Harper also said agencies needed to \"make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past\".\nDr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper \"must face up to the fact\" that the problem was worsening \"because of fundamental policy failures\".\nHe said the government viewed the problem \"through the lens of immigration\" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from \"best practice\".\n\"It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.\"\nThe report revealed thousands of \"front-line\" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.\nSome airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.\nAnd a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK."}

{"text":"Here's a look back at some of the show's most memorable moments:\nThe birth of one of pop music's biggest beefs all started when Kanye West jumped on stage in the middle of Taylor Swift accepting her award for best female video.\nWhen Swift's video for You Belong With Me beat Beyonce's Single Ladies, the rapper headed for the stage and took Taylor's microphone.\nHe said: \"Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'ma let you finish... but Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 had one of the best videos of all time.\"\nKanye was booed by he audience, and when Beyonce herself accepted the award for video of the year later in the ceremony, she invited Swift back onstage to finish her speech.\nAlthough Britney Spears was already a global superstar, this moment cemented her status as a pop culture icon as she performed her hit song I'm a Slave 4 U whilst draped with a seven-foot Burmese python.\nPeta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and several other animal rights groups weren't too thrilled about this.\nRecalling the performance last year, Britney said: \"Oh my goodness, why did I do that? That was so dumb,\" adding that she would \"never\" do it again.\nLady Gaga is no stranger to shocking the world with crazy outfits, and this one surely topped the list.\nIn 2010, the pop star accepted her video of the year award in a dress made from raw beef.\nThe dress was condemned by several animal rights groups but went on to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.\nIn an  interview with American news anchor Anderson Cooper, Gaga explained that her dress was in protest against the US military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, a rule that banned open homosexuality in the armed forces.\nBeyonce announced her pregnancy with Blue Ivy in the most Beyonce way ever.\nAfter delivering a killer performance of Love On Top, she unbuttoned her blazer, dropped her microphone on the floor (we're sure the sound engineers were big fans of that) and began rubbing her tummy.\nThe audience (and her fanbase) went suitably crazy.\nMadonna isn't a stranger to delivering crazy performances - from hanging on a crucifix to rocking up in a ball gown as a French royal, we've seen it all.\nAnd whilst her 1984 performance at the VMAs would be considered quite tame by today's standards, at the time it was pretty groundbreaking.\nFrom her wedding dress costume, to the massive cake she emerged from to her hip thrusting on stage, critics suggested Madonna had set the standard for other artists performing at the VMAs to match.\nBritney and VMA stunts go hand-in-hand, so it's perhaps unsurprising she features more on our list than anybody else.\nThe singer started her 2000 performance in a tuxedo whilst singing I Can't Get No (Satisfaction). All very formal and elegant.\nBut then the whole world watched Britney rip off her clothes to reveal a skin-tone, bedazzled body suit as she began to sing Oops... I Did It Again.\nCritics cited this moment as a turning point for Britney's career - between the song and the costume, she did a pretty good job of trying to shed that Mickey Mouse Club image and show the world she was growing up.\nOne of the most jaw dropping moments of VMA history was when Nicki Minaj called out Miley Cyrus.\nIt all started when the rapper criticised MTV for leaving Anaconda out of the video of the year category, implying that she would have been nominated if she was white.\nTaylor Swift took this as a jab directed at her and responded on Twitter, after which the two engaged in a war of words. And then Miley weighed in on the topic.\n\"What I read sounded very Nicki Minaj, which, if you know Nicki Minaj, is not too kind,\" Miley said.\n\"It's not very polite. I think there's a way you speak to people with openness and love. You don't have to start this pop star against pop star war.\"\nAs Nicki accepted her award on stage and handed back to Miley, who was hosting the ceremony, she said: \"And now, back to this [girl] that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?\"\nNicki later explained to The New York Times Magazine: \"I saw [Miley] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, 'What the...?'\"\n\"The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls.\"\nAnd while we're on the subject of Miley Cyrus...\nAfter finishing her performance of We Can't Stop in 2013, the singer was joined on stage by Robin Thicke and that's when things got a little... R-rated.\nAs Thicke began singing the controversial Blurred Lines, Cyrus began stroking him with a foam finger and doing her own interpretation of \"twerking\" in her latex beige bikini.\nAfter Twitter melted, the singer defended it and claimed that she wanted to make history (mission accomplished) - but now it seems she regrets it.\nNatia Kirkland - commonly known as Lil Mama - seemed to have got caught up in the moment when Jay-Z and Alicia Keys were performing their ode to New York, Empire State of Mind.\nAs the song came to a close, Kirkland who is also a native New Yorker, jumped on stage and posed next to the two superstars with Jay-Z trying his hardest to ignore her.\nIn the middle of performing a mash-up of hits in 2003, Madonna surprised the world by kissing Britney Spears onstage.\nAfter cutting to the confused look on Justin Timberlake's face, Madonna then kissed Christina Aguilera.\nAt a time where both Spears and Aguilera were still trying to shake off their innocent teen-idol images, the kiss was an unforgettable VMA moment.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"text":"You try harder, you do better. You feel the pressure and you respond to it. You impose yourself upon rivals through physical dominance and force of personality.\nIn a sport like rugby union, where players have never been bigger, faster, or hit harder for longer, might is right like never before. Which makes the continual influence of Dan Carter not just illogical but something close to miraculous.\nOn Saturday evening in Lyon, Carter - the leading points scorer in Test history, reigning World Rugby player of the year, World Cup winner for a second time seven months ago - will, in characteristically undemonstrative fashion, lead Racing 92's charge as they take on Saracens in the Champions Cup final.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. At 5ft 10in and 14 stone, the 34-year-old plays an old-fashioned way: finding space where others seek contact, appearing unhurried when fly-halves have never had less time, still managing to play on instinct when set moves and patterns are everywhere you look.\nIt's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. In Racing's semi-final win over Leicester Tigers he made 16 tackles.\nIt's how he does it. Whereas Jonny Wilkinson, the original big-hitting number 10, stopped opposition runners like a rogue flanker and brought gasps from the stands and lungs of the victim alike, Carter tackles like he does everything else - with economy rather than anger, with perfect yet undemonstrative technique, with efficiency over ostentation.\nCarter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. It doesn't really matter. In his swansong he appears to worry less about what he lacks than utilise what he does.\nIf it wasn't the sort of thing that in his home town of Southbridge would trigger disbelief - expressed, because this is the South Island of New Zealand, by something as flamboyant as a raised eyebrow or muted cough - you'd say it was all rather Zen: the impossible calm in a sporting storm, the balance between self and team, equanimity in even the biggest occasions.\nThere is the ritual of his relentless kicking practice, whether at the posts that his father put up next to the family home or on the foreign fields of France; the meditation brought about by those repeated simple actions; the carefully constructed humility of an All Blacks environment where 100-cap heroes like Carter and retired captain Richie McCaw were expected to clean up the dressing room like backroom juniors.\nAnd it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. Wilkinson kicked from the tee with such exaggerated movements that half-cut punters in pubs could do impressions. Dan Biggar has his little soft-shoe shuffle, the 'Biggarena'. Owen Farrell, Carter's opposite number on Saturday, has the laser eyes and robotic head-turn.\nCarter? Even after so many penalties and conversions, it's still hard to remember exactly how he looks in sweet motion. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. He doesn't always stand out, so how can he be outstanding?\n\"He's fascinating,\" admits Ronan O'Gara, arguably Ireland's finest fly-half and now, in early retirement, assistant coach at Carter's Racing.\n\"He's just extremely humble, extremely respectful. He smiles, he always finds a way of getting the job done.\n\"He doesn't stress, he's always polite, he's a breath of fresh air. You can learn an awful lot by just watching him.\"\nCarter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most.\nTennis' Roger Federer at his best was both unhurried and unflustered, but at the moment of victory all that held-back emotion would come crashing out. In cricket, Chris Gayle remains expressionless when thrashing unfortunate bowlers for six after six, but will dance with his top off when victory has been won.\nLionel Messi, for all the gossamer touches with that left foot, is all beautiful bustle and obvious energy, Cristiano Ronaldo all strut and preen on the football pitch.\nEven Tiger Woods, who before his fall could hold his form and nerve in the final-round meltdown like no other golfer, would spit and cuss his way round the course when the mojo left his side.\nCarter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as \"the perfect 10\", all the way through to last October's World Cup final.\nAgainst the Wallabies at Twickenham that day, there was a moment to epitomise so much of what had come before: the All Blacks suddenly under huge pressure, their 17-point lead cut to just four with 15 minutes to go.\nIn his first 110 Tests Carter had landed a total of just six drop-goals. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder.\nForty metres out, the game's greatest prize in the balance, chaos all around. Not for Carter. Instead, a little pocket of space and tranquillity and time where no-one else could see it, a turn of the shoulders and hips, a perfect contact with his left boot to send the ball arcing between the sticks.\nWilkinson was also touched by Eastern philosophy, first by Buddhism as cruel injuries kept keeping him out, later by a Japanese school of thought called Kaizen.\nBecause of the man that Wilkinson is, that was more about a tortured form of self-improvement. \"You imagine being watched by a video 24\/7 to help you get better each day and make good decisions,\" he has said.\nFor Farrell, who shares much of Wilkinson's dedication, Saturday is also about a particular kind of personal development.\nAfter his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too.\n\"It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out,\" the fiery Farrell says.\n\"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do. The more you're calm, the more you're in control and the more you're thinking about the right things.\"\nCarter in control. The career moves on, but the philosophy remains the same.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter."}

Officers responded by firing water cannon and tear gas.\nThe clashes left at least 44 demonstrators and 30 police officers injured, officials said. Dozens of people were also injured on Saturday, when police fired rubber bullets.\nLike the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism.\nAs the embattled Prime Minister Tammam Salam pointed out, it is this issue that threw the spotlight on the \"political rubbish\" that is the real problem - one that has paralysed his own cabinet and the twice-prorogued parliament from taking effective decisions on any issue.\nBehind the political stagnation is the unbending stand-off between the two major political blocs, divided primarily over attitudes to the Syrian regime - the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its mainly Shia allies on one side, and the Saudi-backed, mainly Sunni pro-Western 14 March movement.\nMr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency. That seems unlikely, with regional struggles as unresolved as they are.\nProtesters are also broadening their demands to include an end to the pervasive sectarian political system, something that is even harder to imagine.\nBut public pressure is mounting. If it can at least get the rubbish collected and safely disposed of, that will be a start.\nLebanon wracked by dysfunction\nLebanon cartoons vent anger at rubbish crisis\nOn Monday, the campaign announced that the demonstration planned for Monday evening had been postponed.\n\"The movement has not and will not stop,\" a statement on its Facebook page said. \"Postponing from today to another date this week is not a retreat. We need to reassess and organise our demands.\"\nYou Stink leader Hassan Shams earlier blamed \"infiltrators\" for the violence over the weekend. \"We started peacefully, and we will continue peacefully,\" he told New TV.\nThe protests have been largely co-ordinated by You Stink, which was formed when rubbish began piling up on the streets of Beirut and neighbouring areas after the country's largest landfill was closed last month, with no ready alternative.\nActivists blame political paralysis and corruption for the failure to resolve the crisis.\nFouad al-Hassan, a 65-year-old actor, told the New York Times that he had decided to attend Sunday's rally because he wanted to \"change the system\".\n\"We want new blood or the country will stay the same,\" he added.\nLebanon has been without a president for more than a year, while members of parliament have extended their own terms until 2017 after failing to agree on a law to govern fresh elections.\nThe conflict in neighbouring Syria has also exacerbated political and sectarian divisions, and resulted in the arrival of 1.1 million refugees, putting a strain on the economy and public services.\nMr Salam said that if a cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday was not productive on several issues, including the rubbish crisis, \"there would be no necessity for the government after it\".\n\"I warn that we are going towards collapse if matters continue,\" he added.\n\"Frankly, I have not and will not be a partner in this collapse. Let all officials and political forces bear their responsibilities.\"\nThe prime minister also warned that the government, which brings together all the main Lebanese parties, would be unable to pay civil servants' salaries next month and risked being classified a \"failing state\".\nIf Mr Salam were to resign it could trigger a constitutional crisis because his replacement has to be appointed by the president."}

I would like it to go out to every house and every family, especially where the suffering is greatest, in hospitals, in prisons.\"\nLater in his speech, Pope Francis said: \"We ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\"\nThe Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn.\nIn pictures: Easter festivities\n\"Peace for the Middle East, and particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, who struggle to find the road of agreement, that they may willingly and courageously resume negotiations to end a conflict that has lasted all too long.\n\"Peace in Iraq, that every act of violence may end, and above all for dear Syria, for its people torn by conflict and for the many refugees who await help and comfort.\"\nFor Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - \"where attacks sadly continue\" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.\nHe added: \"Peace in Asia, above all on the Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a  renewed spirit of reconciliation grow.\"\nProfile: Pope Francis\nPope Francis concluded by saying: \"Peace in the whole world, still divided by greed looking for easy gain, wounded by the selfishness which threatens human life and the family, selfishness that continues in human trafficking, the most extensive form of slavery in this 21st Century.\"\nBBC Rome correspondent, Alan Johnston, says the Pope has reinforced his image as a man of simple, down-to-earth tastes, not wearing the more ostentatious of papal costumes and, for the moment, not moving into the grandiose papal apartments.\nOne pilgrim in Rome on Sunday, Briton Tina Hughes, said that Francis represented a \"new beginning\".\n\"I think he brings something special. He connects with people. I feel good about him,\" she told Reuters.\nIn the days before Easter, the Pope had reached out to women and Muslims.\nDuring a Holy Thursday Mass at a youth detention centre he washed and kissed the feet of 12 people, including two girls and two Muslims, and in a Good Friday procession referred to the \"friendship of our Muslim brothers and sisters\" in the Middle East.\nBut our correspondent says that, after Easter, the Pope will have to begin tackling the key issues facing the Catholic Church, such as reforming a Vatican bureaucracy riven by infighting and allegations of corruption, and tackling the issue of clerical sexual abuse.\nVatican watchers will also be keeping a keen eye on new appointments to key positions.\nIn his Easter homily, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, invited the Pope to visit.\nThe patriarch, the most senior Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, also urged the international community to take \"concrete and effective decisions to find a balanced and just solution for the Palestinian cause, which lies at the heart of all the Middle East's troubles\"."}

{"text":"President Rodrigo Duterte has said he wants to \"walk the extra mile\" to achieve peace, in a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. BBC Monitoring's Mark Wilson examines the challenges ahead.\nThe Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) began its armed struggle in the late 1960s. Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare. The insurgency was established by academic, author and poet Jose Maria Sison.\nThe CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), is believed to number around 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s during the martial law era.\nThe NPA has engaged in killings, bombings and hostage-taking across the archipelago, collecting \"revolutionary taxes\" from businesses in the areas it controls.\nBoth the CPP and NPA were designated foreign terrorist organisations by the US government in 2002.\nThe rebels strongly oppose the US military presence in the Philippines and have in the past killed American service personnel stationed in the country.\nSince the 1980s they have entered into talks with successive governments, but a peace deal has remained elusive.\nMr Duterte wants to end the insurgency and has said he is willing to \"walk the extra mile\" for peace.\nHe has tried to revive the peace process and has already held two rounds of formal discussions with the rebels since he took office last year.\nThe president has attempted to win the rebels' trust through a series of confidence-building measures. These include appointing rebel sympathisers to his cabinet, releasing high-ranking rebels from prison and offering land to NPA members if talks succeed.\nThe rebels have reciprocated by releasing police officers they were holding hostage.\nBoth sides have also separately declared a series of unilateral ceasefires, but are yet to agree a joint ceasefire deal.\nThe ceasefires have been marred by the killings of soldiers and rebels.\nGovernment officials accused the CPP of being unable to control its armed wing after four soldiers were killed in an NPA landmine attack in July.\nThe attack led Mr Duterte to temporarily lift the government ceasefire.\nDays later, an NPA rebel was killed in a battle with the military in Surigao del Norte province.\nThe rebels, who say they will not give up arms even if a deal is reached, have accused the military of using Mr Duterte's drug war as a pretext to mount operations in rebel areas amid the ceasefire.\nA real sticking point in recent months has been the issue of freeing around 400 detained rebels.\nThe CPP demands that the government grant a general amnesty to these rebels as part of negotiations.\nAfter Mr Duterte refused, insisting that the rebels must first agree to a joint ceasefire deal, the rebels accused him of \"capriciously changing his mind\" on the issue.\nSince the last round of talks in October, the rebels have also taken issue with some of Mr Duterte's policies at home and abroad.\nThey have criticised both his warming relations with Russia and China and his move to allow a hero's burial for late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\nAt the forthcoming talks on 18 January, to be held in Rome, the two sides will aim to reach a bilateral ceasefire deal.\nThat the talks have got this far demonstrates the desire for peace on both sides, but delays in granting amnesties to detained rebels is threatening to derail negotiations.\nWide ranging rebel-proposed social and economic reforms, which the CPP has described as the core of the talks, are also still to be agreed."}

In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up.\nHowever, Mr Williamson pointed out that the pace of expansion had cooled since the beginning of the year, \"reflecting widespread concern about the potential future impact of Brexit\".\nOfficial growth figures for the second quarter were revised up to 0.7% last week, by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), from an initial reading of 0.6%.\nPantheon Economics agreed that the Bank of England would probably refrain from cutting rates in November but predicted growth would continue to slow in the coming months, \"as firms hold back from hiring and investment due to 'hard' Brexit risk and households' real incomes are squeezed by rising inflation\".\nThe PMI survey showed that services firms reported the fastest rate of input price inflation since February 2013 in September, with providers subsequently raising their charges at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe services industry - which includes everything from financial advice to retailers - accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy."}

So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.\n\"Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.\"\nHe added: \"I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered.

{"text":"The team's technique involves building a 3D image of a patient's brain in a matter of minutes.\nStrokes occur about 152,000 times a year in the UK, according to the Stroke Association.\nIn Scotland, NHS Scotland considers strokes to be the third commonest cause of death.\nWhen a stroke happens speed is of the essence. First in diagnosing what kind of stroke it is, then treating it.\nThat is because there are two main types - ischemic and haemorrhagic - and two very different ways of treating them.\nBoth MRI and CT scanners can provide an image of the brain and the damage done, but are big and expensive. Patients have to come to them.\nThe mathematicians envisage a new type of detector small enough to ride in an ambulance.\nIt will be a helmet containing microwave antennae, and will fire the microwave through the patient's brain and receive the resulting signals.\nThe results will be sent to a supercomputing centre, which is where the maths comes in.\nThe techniques developed at Strathclyde and on the continent can produce a 3D image of the brain - and its injury - within 15 minutes.\nThe sensor hardware is being developed by the Austrian imaging company EMTensor.\nAt the moment it exists as two prototypes in a hospital in Vienna.\nEach is a cylindrical chamber consisting of five rings, each of 32 antennae.\nThe next step will be to make the device portable.\nOne of the mathematics team is Dr Victorita Dolean, a Reader in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics.\n\"Our aim will be to produce a portable and less expensive device that can detect strokes in real time,\" she says.\n\"The idea would be that we'd send these electromagnetic waves into the brain and then the properties of the tissues - which will be healthy or sick - will be detected by measurements of the data on this helmet.\n\"The data will be sent to a supercomputing centre.\n\"We have designed some open source software that is able to reconstruct, precisely and in real time, an image of the brain and then send it back to the doctors to interpret this data and make the diagnosis.\"\nThe team's mathematical approach has already won the team the Bull-Joseph Fourier Prize for excellence in numerical simulation and data processing.\n\"We could not have done this a few years ago because we needed powerful advances in electronics, in computer science, in algorithms, in mathematics,\" Dr Dolean says.\nShe now expects the sensor helmets to be in the field in two to four years - not just in ambulances, but anywhere they might be needed.\n\"They'll be cheap and portable and able to act as an emergency device,\" she says.\nAnd that quick, on the spot diagnosis could mean survival for stroke victims."}

I have huge respect for him as a coach and a person having coached against him on numerous occasions,\" Robinson said.\nAt the 2011 World Cup Scotland failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time and Robinson is keen to emulate the template that brought the All Blacks success at the tournament.\nGraham Henry had Test-hardened coaches in former Wales coach Steve Hansen and ex-All Blacks head coach Wayne Smith as his assistants.\nJohnson's solicitor, Duncan Sandlant, of Esportif international, had indicated that Scotland was not his only option, saying: \"Scott has a number of options which he is seriously considering.\"\nThe Australian had been linked in reports in New Zealand with a role as assistant to new All Blacks head coach Hansen.\nBut Ian Foster's appointment as one of Hansen's back-room staff made such a move unlikely for Johnson."}
