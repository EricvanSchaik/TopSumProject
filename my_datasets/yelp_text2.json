{"text":"The staff is super friendly and drinks are usually cold and properly made and reasonably priced! Great beer selection and wonderful gals behind the bar!! Just what bee cave needs!!!"}
{"text":"Food was par. Online dessert menu says they had a Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other. They sold me on it. Got there and was told menu online isn't updated, sorry.\n\nThat was fine, until we had the most annoyed server in the place. Received the HARDEST eye roll of the night for bothering to ask for ketchup. Sorry, I tend to dip my fries in something. \n\nPass"}
{"text":"This place was great! I wish they had more room because we were eating on the way back to Houston and it would have been nice to sit and enjoy the biscuits!"}
{"text":"East Van hole-in-the-wall in the style of all classic hole-in-the-walls: tasty food + questionable cleanliness + rock bottom prices.\n\nFriends speak well of their Adobo Chicken, went for that and added Pancit Bihon (fried noodles with shredded chicken & veg). Hoped it would be enough for two hungry humans. Silly us, these two dishes were enough to feed 3 or 4 normal Vancouverites. \n\nThe food was good - nothing amazing, just solid homestyle cooking reminiscent of meals made by my Filipino friends' parents back in the day. We'll definitely be back.\n\nPro tip: 2015 Entertainment Book nets $8 off a two entree order, it was so inexpensive for what we got that we actually felt kind of guilty about it."}
{"text":"Smaller place in the area. You may overlook it because it is on the side street.  However,  nice pub with great service.  Be sure to try the fried Avacado... It was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Santarpio's is not just about the pie and bbq, it's about the whole experience. The neighborhood,the line, the rec room decor, the locals, and the throw back waiters all rolled into one of best classic pizza joints in Boston. The pizza itself is thin crust (corn meal on bottom) plain sauce, and the usual cast of toppings. The pies are on the small size, but very inexpensive. Not New Haven good but pretty good for Boston. Go on summer night throw back a few cold beers with a garlic and onion pizza with some friends and call it a night."}
{"text":"Best place for wings and beer! Service is always great and food is always fresh. My 5 year old daughter loves the chicken tenders and frys's."}
{"text":"I usually wash my car when I go home to Houston but the few times I have needed to wash my car I have been going to this location. Even though I live in central Austin, I come all the way down to this side of town for this place. I like that this  carwash is cheap, quick, does the job, and has free vacuums (actually, I love the free vacuums...). There are guys who scrub the tough spots that the machine wouldn't be able to get on its own before you enter the wash, which is nice. I normally get the cheapest or middle option, but I've gotten great service every time I've been here. The last time I was here they let me go through the machine twice because my car wasn't clean enough - thank you. Today when I visited again, the attendant by the pay station asked me when was the last time I treated myself to a $13 wash, to which I responded with silence and a half-grin, and Roland, the manager, gave me a complimentary $13 wash!! Shout out to Palms because I used that money to go towards my dinner tonight  See you guys next time!"}
{"text":"We picked a crowded Sunday to check out the aquarium.  It had some great exhibits both inside and outside.  \n\nI enjoyed the beluga whale exhibit you can view them from both the inside and outside.  As well as the otter exhibit.  The otter exhibit, those little guys like the attention and they are real cute.\n\nThere was a frog exhibit inside that was interesting as well as informative.  Some of them are going instinct, which is a good indication of change in the ecosystem.\n\nInteresting information on the north pole as well.  \n\nAll in all informative but try to avoid the weekends if you can as they are jam packed.\n\nWe found using our credit card out at the kiosk outside was quicker for ingress than waiting in line to pay in person which we would have paid via credit card anyway so that just made the process quicker.  Also, there is an aquarium employee outside by the kiosk on this particular weekend in case you have any difficulties.\n\nI loved the soda and water machines that took credit cards.  Canada has it all over the US in that regard as anyone with a credit card can buy a soda and not worry about exact change or which currency you were carrying.\n\nI'd visit this place again."}
{"text":"Great staff, wonderful service. The wine list is top notch, and the wine by the bottle prices are pretty good as well.\n\nThe steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and the side dishes were done well too. I highly recommend the Boulder Cork"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 7 years since moving to Newton and really can't imagine a better barbershop.  Tony, Greg and their dad all do a great job and the feel of the place is very relaxed and welcoming - some of the people clearly have known each other for many years, others are brand new.  They're also great with boys, and the fact that my wife enjoys taking our two sons (3 and 9) says a lot."}
{"text":"Definitely sweet, and definitely rich, but also definitely the freshest donuts I've ever had. Our table got the Black Betty (blackberry, cream cheese, cinnamon, and honey) and Dirty Harry (donut holes with chocolate and coconut). I personally preferred the Betty because the fruit cut through the sugar, though the Harry makes for a better photoshoot with its little cauldron bowl. I don't know if I'm ready for donut burgers, but the desserts are an experience!"}
{"text":"Dude, dude... dude! This place is awesome and by awesome, I mean totally surreal. A ghetto little gym in SE that fulfills it's functional and pragmatic purpose. You can go there and lift weights or run on a treadmill, but the real value lies in the totally old school atmosphere and the happiness such atmosphere affords. The walls are lined with old pictures of weight lifting dudes, the place is filled with regular joes in cut off sweat pants and the equipment is ancient."}
{"text":"Last week, I had a brilliant cup of Costa Rican coffee here.  It was medium-bodied, smooth and lacked the awful, acid inducing heartburn found in $4 cups of Starbucks.  \n\n{However, one should expect brilliant coffee from George Howell, one of the most recognized and respected names in coffee.  He's the owner of Terroir (served at True Grounds) and former owner of the once adored Coffee Connection, which used to be sprinkled throughout the Boston area before Starbucks bought them out.} \n\nThis morning, a blueberry scone delighted the palette and made me wish I'd bought one more for later.  It was so good, it's hard to believe the English invented it.  \nOh, and to the calm, cheery people working the counter at 8 am, thanks so much.  You were so pleasant, for a few moments, I thought I was in sunny California."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great place for some strong BBQ. Fortunately we ordered a variety platter. I felt like there was good flavor and well cooked, but there was some wavering in the quality. You can't go wrong with the chicken or pulled pork! \n\nThere was a smoke flavor that was inviting to start, but could be a bit overpowering. Our waitress was easygoing and attentive. My only complaints were that the only bread available was sliced white and the poor quality of the beef brisket."}
{"text":"The first time I went here they would have gotten one star. Their food and service quality has gone up. They have really good pizza, really good wings and good burgers. And really yummy alcohol. Sometimes it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Great service. The place looked clean and tidy. I did not have to wait long for take out. I ordered the roast lamb and Kalamari dinner. The roast lamb was flavourful and tender. The Kalamari was done to perfection - very crispy and tender when I got it home. The container holding the Kalamari had a hole on top already to prevent it from getting soggy. It was more than enough for the 2 of us. We had leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I ordered a large order from here via foodler for a work related program and they were timely with the delivery. The food was delicious and was enjoyed by everyone. I particularly enjoyed the palak paneer. A quick note about the portions: I ordered from the catering menu and the size large pan, though stated that it's for 10 people, can definitely feed 20! We had so much leftover. Will be ordering from here again in the future."}
{"text":"I wish Menchie's had more flavors. There are roughly a dozen choices versus 30-40 at local ice cream shops. Their pineapple is my favorite but they just Introduced Keylime which is also excellent. The variety of toppings is their strength but their product is a little expensive. For two cups of yogurt we never escape for under $15. When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink. If he came here, he might tear off his hair piece in frustration. So unless you are a cost-conscious Scientologist, you will likely enjoy Menchie's."}
{"text":"Paid $32 for a complete wash, and was happy with the results. I typically go to a MooMoo or some other automatic wash, but this is MUCH better because the \"finishers\" (guys who wipe down the car) get all the spots the machines missed."}
{"text":"Kate is a wonderful young woman to work with- professional, kind, and generous with her time.  If the lighting changes just at the end of a shoot, she'll stick it out to help you get the perfect shot.  Skip the studio style photos and go for natural light with Kate.  In addition, she does wonderful editing and will work with whatever needs or aesthetic vision you might have in mind.  Although she has done a large amount of musician headshots and family photos, she is great for fitness\/yoga\/pilates teachers and couples.  Book her, stat!"}
{"text":"Went here for my husbands holiday party a few nights ago, the inside is cute, funky and eclectic. Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!"}
{"text":"For a first time visit the Broadway near cambie location is a little something different. With a bar and separate fast food setup and feel, I found the Mexican \"day of the dead\" decor with pop 90's music to be oddly relaxing. My boyfriend had a beef taco for $4.50 and for me we mostly shared a pulled pork taco bowl salad for $9.50. My boyfriend found his choice underfilling while i found mine too filling for one. We chose to come here for food due to its proximity to where we were taking a class at shortly. Interesting place trying to be super trendy while still only really coming across as a cafeteria of sorts."}
{"text":"I love the original, one of my favorites in the area (Can't beat Regina's on Thacher though.)  I couldn't have been more disappointed with the Peabody location.  Not an exaggeration, I have had a way better pie at Papa Gino's.  Huge letdown, but I may give it another shot when the wait\/crowds die down."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that calls itself 'number one' in spanish and the best cuban restaurant north of Miami; I was dissapointed.  First, I have not known a cuban restaurant not to carry vaca frita. Second, mofongo is mainly puerto rican.  Thirdly a cuban restaurant would call their pork lechon, not pernil. Btw, their 'pernil' sandwich was salty and dry. The appetizers were good, which saved them from a 2 star rating in my book.  There are plenty other cuban selections in Orlando that offer a better and more authentic experience."}
{"text":"I give four stars for the Manager and the food..Service was horrible, food was amazing and manager John is very experienced with guest recovery. Great ambiance and still kinks to be worked out.  Would advise you to go at a slow hour for your first experience. Have faith it will improve."}
{"text":"I'm really not a Jamaican food eater; however this food was banging.  I ate it cold so I could imagine what it would taste like hot.  I  encourage all that can and will try Dat Fire Jerk Chicken."}
{"text":"Me:  Two shots of Jager please!\nBartender:  WANT TO MAKE THEM DOUBLES?!!!!?  *With one hand makes a shaka (surfing) sign; with the other hand points to a sign reading \"Make your Jager shot a double!\"*\nMe:  Are doubles discounted?\nBartender:  HELL YEA!!!!!\nMe:  Cool; two double shots of Jager please!\nBartender:  *Places two double shot glasses on the bar.  Takes Jager bottle out of fridge.*  Actually they are not discounted.\nMe:  So a double is the same price as two singles?\nBartender:  Yes.\nMe:  Then why did you tell me they were on discount?\nBartender:  *Pauses.*  SO YOU COULD GET FUCKED UP!!!!!!  \nMe:  Two single shots of Jager please."}
{"text":"Delish! Stopped in on a random Sunday and so glad I did. Normally when eating healthy I have found making good choices while eating out can be hard. But here the options are endless and sound so good. I got the Bombay bowl which was so filling and my sister got the avocado crunch wrap which she said she loved. All in all customer service was fabulous, food was fresh and totally tasty."}
{"text":"I enjoy living at Avana! The complex is in a great location convenient to shopping, restaurants, and the interstate. The office staff (Brittni, Dereck, and Antwoin) are all super nice and professional. They do a great job with planning resident appreciation events and they respond promptly to inquiries. The maintenance crew is also very nice and responsive. I would recommend this property to anyone looking to make Atlanta their home!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh everyone raves about this place but I don't see the big deal. Staff was too busy gossiping to be attentive, food was ok. The only \"good\" thing here is the coffers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"This has got the be the busiest Wawa in Orlando! Stopped on my way to work to get a bacon egg cheese croissant. i had to wait five minutes as they were cooking, The store on crowded as everyone was buying breakfast and\/or lunch.  My sandwich was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bacon was crispy and it was just GOOD when I bit into it. Love this breakfast sandwich.  The coffee fresh, hot and just darn good!  This place is like a DRUG and the addiction has begun!!!"}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Portland so I thought I would use 5 star...... which should be renamed 0 star. This is hands down the worst dry cleaning service I have ever used. With zero customer service skills, poor cleaning abilities and a rude stuff, this place should be condemned. Do not use 5 star. I wouldn't give them any starts but I am obligated by the app to give them at least one undeserving star."}
{"text":"Good food and plenty of it. Wife loved her omelette. Good French toast and bacon. I asked for crispy hash browns and bacon and unlike most places they served me crispy hash browns and bacon."}
{"text":"I visited this location shortly after it arrived in Baldwin Park. The service was really slow as the staff seemed to still be figuring out how to run the machines. There was an advertisement for the YF app, so I downloaded it while I was waiting. When I showed the employee when I was checking out so that I could get a \"credit\" or \"punch,\" the employee told me this location didn't have the app capabilities yet. I got the yogurt with strawberries blended in. I was really disappointed in the texture of the yogurt. It was grainy. The taste was fine but I wasn't able to get past the texture, so I didn't finish it. Bummer. Maybe I'll go back and try it again. I hope the kinks will have been worked out and it's a better experience."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places for vietnamese grub! Very authentic and although they hardly speak english, the people here are really nice. Will always recommend others to try it."}
{"text":"The bulk of the stars was because this is one of the few places in the area I've seen that will seat you before your entire party arrives.  In my case, one person at a table of 7 - huge kudos for that & luckily my crew arrived within minutes of me sitting down.\n\nThe food was just ok and the service was scarce. They didn't have enough staff and the poor server was hustling, he just rarely got around to us - a couple got up from the table to order drinks at the bar. \n\nI did love the chips & hot sauces and we ordered guacamole. The $9 price of the guac is steep for small serving but still was the most favorite & most flavorful part of my meal."}
{"text":"great lunch special $5.50 - chicken teriyaki and soda.\n\nclean, nicely decorated establishment.\n\na good choice of sauces to douse with -  Load up the Siracha 'til my nose runs and runs"}
{"text":"I love Retro game night!  This was my fourth time! And I signed up for an annual pass. Even more excited for their upcoming events and exhibits. \nThe history center has something for everyone! I love that they are in an old courthouse too. There are several floors and rooms to explore. \nThe staff has always been friendly,  knowledge and welcoming."}
{"text":"After only about a 20 minute wait on a busy weekend night, the friendly staff was able to get our party of 12 (8 kids!) seated and we were soon thoroughly enjoying a great Mexican dinner with nice portions.  This place will definitely be on our list each time we visit the Orlando area."}
{"text":"I've frequented this location a few times over my older years, but not since getting involved more with Yelp. I've always been relatively pleased with Home Depots, in general. \n\nThis time, I stopped by to see what shower heads they had to offer. Upon passing through the front doors, I was pleasantly greeted by a woman - power to the female fixer-uppers in this world!! I'm not one to search and search on my own for a product. My personal motto: If they work there, they should know their establishment.\" The lady asked if there was anything she could help with, so I took advantage, and asked away. She pointed met the exact section and aisle. BAM! Get 'er done. Found the end cap, studied the selection, made a choice, and headed to the register."}
{"text":"A Dive Bar in every sense of the word. You walk in and you're immediately greeted with the smell of a place that still always you to smoke inside, now at 2am when I've been drinking and bar hopping for hours I don't mind this, at 6 in the afternoon I recognize it and can do without it. \n\nIt's dimly lit and their are Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling which is a nice touch. There are two pool tables by the entrance and a modern juke box to select your favorite tunes you enjoy listening to. What Dive Bar wouldn't be complete without an ATM inside? The bar itself is long with plenty of sits and the drinks are cheap which I love.\n\nThere are a mix of booths, high tables and bar chairs and it's a pretty spacious bar, if you love the neighborhood bar feel this may be the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great food & Service,glad i stopped in for the 1st time,may u all have a great 2018. buy local stay local,thank you"}
{"text":"I had a piece of metal stuck in my tire so I went over to Leal's. They patched the tire in 15 minutes for $15 and I was on my way. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  No matter what lady I get she always does a perfect job.  The service has always been quick and neat, and a mani\/pedi is only $30."}
{"text":"Great value, lots of gluten free options and very nice staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have lost several inches all over since I started about a month ago. I've only been to Robert's class in the afternoon, but I hear the other instructors are awesome! Robert is very helpful and professional. The gym is clean with no weird gym smells."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst timeshare experience! HORRIBLE customer service, we actually had some employees snap at us! We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn't sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for. Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day. The dryer didnt work. I complained & was told that it just doesnt work well.... after 2.5hrs our clothes were still wet! My fridge broke, they came & turned the setting to \"coldest\" & called it fixed! It BROKE, settings cease to be relevant. They didnt come back to repair or replace itn just let me wait. W had to have security let us into our room 1-3 times per day. Security snapped at us & insisted that we put it next to our phone which we did not. Nobody smiles, it must suck to work there? Waiting for security & maintenance & having damp clothes laying across everything to dry, then having to repack, move to a different condo then unpack AGAIN wasted a full day of our trip. One employee (Ana Delis) cut me off & went off on me when I told her the problems with my condo. She basically told me to tell it to someone else, she isn't responsible for our condo problems but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH RUDER!! This has been an absolute nightmare. I'd never own after knowing what kind of rude people they hire. Seriously... stay away from Westgate lakes orlando... the worst! I actually was in tears during our vacation because of Westgate employees & the condo."}
{"text":"Good quality, affordable, men's hair cuts.  What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Nice place, good people, huge menu. Toast burned, but potatoes, poached egg and oatmeal were very good. I did not even ask for almond or soy milk for the coffee. Woburn is not progressive. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for great variety. I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop....."}
{"text":"The best corned beef hash I have ever had on the north shore. Fast and polite service."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times had amazing (5 star) food. The first time around I had some delicious sushi and the second time I had the stir-fry oxtopus that was out of this world! Service been average both times. Will totally be back for some more of the yummy food!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this pep boys and thought I would share.  My brakes started grinding last week so I got it in there as fast as I could.  This location is very convenient to where I work so I thought I would give them a try.  When I came in, I was greeted by Lawrence who was very friendly and told me he would call me as soon as he had a chance to look at them.  He called back around 30 min later to let me know both sets of brake pads needed to be replaced as well as the rotors on the back set.  Lawrence was willing to send me photos and  give me coupons to help with the price.  I would definitely bring my car here again for repairs and ask specifically for Lawrence.  I am glad I now have a go-to place that is also very convenient!"}
{"text":"As they say, you get what you pay for. It could be true for some of the luxurious purchases we've had. Some just ride on their name but truly their quality is awful. \n\nWhat made Tanner Goods stand out is they are local. They have excellent service and gives advice for people like me who needs advice in how to keep my denim well. Yes, besides leather goods they also sell clothes. A bit spendy than most generic stores that you might go like Macy's, Target, Fred Meyer but they all pale in comparison when you'll compare the details of merchandise they have. \n\nSure, I could use a nice pencil. Mind you, they are cute but not for $10. But there are items like shirts, key fobs, coasters that are also well made and could fit your budget. \n\nThis is the place if you're looking to give me a gift. Don't worry, I accept gifts for any occasion. I don't need to have a local and US made product all the time but when I can, I do it right. And this is the place for some of it."}
{"text":"I just discovered this gem yesterday when I was only seeking a brow wax. Jessica took such good care of me. It was the best chocolate wax ever! \nI had to come back the very next day for the best facial. I'm super pleased. This is my new fave place for sure."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by Retro Station after hearing that there were new owners. As soon as we walked in, we noticed the changes. The atmosphere is a fun, 50's theme. Very cool. We ordered the cheese garlic bread and a deep dish pizza. I must tell you, the garlic bread was exceptional and the pizza is one of the best I have tried in a long time. The service was awesome and the owners are the sweetest people. They have really turned the place around. They made us feel like very special customers and made sure that we enjoyed our night. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I'm confused at how this place has any stars.  The food is not what we expected at all. It was dry tasteless and completely unappetizing. The I got two tacos, I cant even remember which ones, but one had this weird mayonnaise based sauce, the fish was hard, the cajun fries were very salty and came with some orange mayo like sauce,  the kids chicken tenders were hard as rocks and looked like the once you can get in the frozen section at Walmart, the shrimp appetizer was hard as rocks and swimming in some runny sauce, just completely unedible. I mean when our little ones don't want to eat the food, we know its bad... The place was just disgusting, the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky. Yuck. We will never come back to thus place. We spent about $60 and left hungry. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to shopping at Sprouts.  It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No \"thank you\", no \"do you need a hand\", not even the now common \"there you go\".  \n\nThe place just opened! Haven't they trained the staff any customer service skills? I won't be going back.  \n\nAnd, the prices are not that great.  They have fake specials - 1 pound packages of strawberries @ 2 for $5 but a 2 pound package for $3.98. Similar with blueberries.  And many empty produce bag dispensers.  Management needs to wake up."}
{"text":"The best fried clams in the city (state? East coast?) are served at B&G, no question.  Add the freshly made tartar sauce and it's heavenly!  A good secret is that they take reservations on the day-of, after 11am.  Sometimes you'll get stuck at a table that's too small for your party, but if you improvise, share plates and get cozy, you'll have a great time!  Or sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare each plate and shuck oyster after oyster - you'll even get to see Barbara in action every now and then. Try the rieslings that are on the wines-by-the-glass menu as a great complement to a salty, briny oyster plate.  And save room for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...\n\nThe host greeted us, not by saying \"welcome to BJs,\" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. \n\nThe place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar\/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.\n\nWell--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. \n\nI never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. \n\nInstead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.\n\nAnyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape\u00f1o burger, which came with fried jalape\u00f1os. The burger had only a couple of jalape\u00f1os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.\n\n\nWhatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for my second time. I just moved to Columbus within the last 4 months. The first time I went I ordered the Hoffbrau Schnitzel. It was really good. Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. \n\nI went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!"}
{"text":"I cannot tell you if it is authentic Cuban food or not since I am not Cuban,but after eating so much Cuban food for a year in the Mecca of Cuban food in the country (Miami) I believe my review could be a helpful. I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population."}
{"text":"I just recently bought a 2017 Toyota Camry se and couldn't be more happy. The sales guy Mati was very professional and answered all my questions and was very nice. I traded in my 2014 Toyota Tacoma which had a salvaged title which I found out about two years later and they basically paid it off for me. Every other dealerships I went to didn't come close to what Beaverton Toyota offered me for Tacoma so I made right choice going back 2 days later.  Got a brand new car and happy to get out of my salvaged Tacoma. Mati was Outstanding and would definetly recommend this place to anyone who wants to purchase a vehicle."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Modern Pilates off and on for 2 years. I'm back on again and really a fan of their new studio space, which they've been in since sometime last year (2011).\n\nPilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach.\n\nThey really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs.\n\nIf anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess. The staff does a nice job with customer service as well, but sometimes last minute changes can be difficult.\n\nOverall, I have no problem recommending this place for anyone who's looking for a great Pilates workout!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   I had Wonton soup and Szechuan Chicken, both tasted very good, and were presented well.   Several nice touches in the service, and a friendly and welcoming staff.  This is a hidden gem in Orlando."}
{"text":"There are so few coffee shop options up north beside the typical Starbucks chains, so I was pretty stoked to find this place by stumbling across their groupon deal.They always seem to have a living social or groupon online!\n\nThere's a limited amount of seating and plugs on the wall, but I haven't had any problems since I've only been here on a weekday. Great atmosphere to get some work done.\n\nMy favorite is the iced chai so far since I have a sweet tooth with my drinks and their menu definitely has a lot more of those for me to try. It also helps they have food on their menus in case you want to work through lunch and stays all day."}
{"text":"Never met a Cactus Club I didn't like! \n\nHave eaten here twice in the last week, both times because this location tends to be less crowded than the other Cacti in Vancouver, and I'm always sure to get a booth here. The service leaves little room for fault-finding, and the food is standard Cactus fare -- i.e., predictably good (but not outstanding -- i.e., exactly what one comes to Cactus for). \n\nThe men's room is clean, spacious, and well appointed with couch and fireplace. Aaaaaand, the servers are good at, and seem to enjoy, their jobs, which makes all the difference in the dining experience. \n\nFor anyone seeking a very satisfying dinner for two for under $100, Cactus is a great go-to option.\n\nWell deserved 5-stars."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for two for $59.00 for the sushi making class. It was a really great deal when a regular class at full price is $60.00 each person.\n\nThe location is pretty nice. Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. \n\nThe actually restaurant was small.  Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations.\n\nThis is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23.\nSo this very small room because CRAMPED.\n\nI went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a  spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi.\n\nThere were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??'  So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. \n\nWe ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others.\n\nThe teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. \n\nWe took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. \n\nAll in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time."}

{"text":"Called these guys up at 11pm the other night to get some much needed group for my well-drank and poorly fed group. We ordered onion rings as an app (super oily and terrible for you but hey that means they actually taste good). \n\nOne guy somehow ordered more plates of food than would fit on the table and they were gone within 15 minutes. I would assume he liked his.\n\nI ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which I've had many times and always love. The only issue with the sandwich is that it has the Captain Crunch effect on the roof of my mouth? Weird, but worth the trouble.\n\nAnyways, it's quite nice that this place has a kitchen open til 1am. Seriously? I had no idea you could get good food like this that late. If you come for lunch or dinner, you may have to wait, but it's worth it.\n\nThis is also the place that I took my girlfriend on our first date. Since the food was really good and our mouths were always full, it cut back a bit on the awkwardness."}
{"text":"Two stars for friendly service and base for seating. However my experience with the meal was Far Beyond and satisfactory. So much so that I did not finish my meal. My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!\n\nI expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich. The few people that we saw eating the chicken sandwich had actually deconstructed it and ate it with fork and knife. I was incredibly unhappy with the quality of my meal I couldn't even finish it! I ended up leaving and going to chicken and gun and thoroughly enjoyed my meal there! I'm upset that we had to waste 30 plus dollars to find out that this place was just another fail of a good review location"}
{"text":"My experience at the caf\u00e9 was not what I expected. I had read and heard great reviews about the food and was disappointed when I tried the pork flatbread sandwich and the hand pulled flat noodles. \nThe flatbread sandwich was sub-par due to the fact that the pork was dry and bland while the bread was tasteless.\nThe noodles were good, but I did not get as much flavor as expected from the dish. Having tasted other Chinese places in Chinatown, I cannot get myself to give this place more than 2 stars. Furthermore, the atmosphere was fine but I wish it was better as there was no A\/C on a hot humid day, napkins were like tissues and the place only took cash."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty health conscious guy who doesn't eat many donuts in a year, but when I do ..... it's going to be Blue Star or Pip's. Each Blue Star location has a unique selection of consistently high quality donuts that are just interesting and weird enough to make stopping in a treat. And unlike the pink-boxed donuts everyone lines up for, Blue Star's donuts aren't giant, obscenely sugary, relatively flavorless, or greasy. In fact, they're exactly the opposite: compact in size, strong in flavor, and fresh tasting. \n\nWhen you want to break your diet or treat yourself, friends, and family, to foodie Portland, Blue Star is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great food. Recommend the grilled shrimp app, white bean soup, Brussels sprouts, risotto, and lamb. Great wine selection and interesting cocktail menu. \n\nGood service.

{"text":"I've had the pleasure of working with Mandy at a number of weddings and also being a part of the weddings & special events industry, I can see the difference between a quality planner and a hack in this saturated landscape.  Mandy is absolutely of the former, with the rare quality of being on top of her game -- yet is always calm and collected.  Never during the events I worked with her did I sense that she was overwhelmed and everything always went off smoothly and without a hitch!  A Planner's vibe sets the tone for the rest of the vendors working an event and if I had a Planner like Mandy to work with every weekend, I'd jump on the opportunity."}
{"text":"This might be the best Chinese buffet in Austin Texas. Clean, friendly, with good food as long as you go during lunch or dinner hours (it gets pretty stale during off hours, but that seems to be an issue with most buffet places). Their sushi bar is out of this world with freshness and selection. I've been going here for years, and I'd say 80% of my trips have been very satisfactory, with my only so-so experiences being when I've gone during off hours. The dessert bar is okay, but they have a ton of fresh fruit and their apple crisp is very good."}

I needed an itemized receipt to be reimbursed by my job and I left the billing department 4 messages over the course of 2 weeks after they billed my card a week late for charges that I did not know that I would be billed for.  I had to involve Starwood AND call and speak with the general manager before the billing department would send me an itemized bill. It was so frustrating....if you stay here, get a copy of EVERYTHING before you leave because clearly they don't know."}
{"text":"Amazing family run northern Indian cuisine. The food is very authentic. It's just as good or if not better than one of the top ranked Indian restaurants in NYC off 53rd and 2nd. You can taste each spice in the chicken vindaloo. Beware ordering your dish spicy. It will make you sweat. Stick with medium. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Portland. Great place to stop in for a slice. Crispy, thin crust with delicious ingredients. Also cool that the offer homemade sodas with unique flavors."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot of food, and every single the we ordered was good. I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for."}

{"text":"As a celiac diner, I had an incredible experience at Pammy's for my anniversary dinner. Our waiter, Blake, was super knowledgeable and attentive, and asked the kitchen about anything that he wasn't 100% sure about. The food was delicious-- everything from the antipasti board to the asparagus to the gluten free pasta. Cool and inviting ambiance, lively without being too loud to talk, friendly staff, the full package. Definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it is close to home and they have a lovely outdoor patio that's twice as big as the restaurant. The food and service though have been completely average to disappointing on my last couple of visits. I was just there a few nights ago with a party of 7, the waiter, who is Italian and speaks English with a very heavy accent (and therefore hard to understand at times) was rude and aggressive. He talked over people when they asked questions about the menu and wasn't helpful with any answers, someone asked about the clam pasta entree and he said \"it's clams and spaghetti\"... it was awkward. He didn't suggest or ask if anyone wanted wine or drinks so we had to ask for them, he didn't ask if anyone wanted coffee or dessert so we had to ask for both. The service was slow, we were there over 3 hours. Two people at the table ordered the clam pasta and both thought it was completely bland, the other entrees were fine but not fantastic."}

You are always shown the correct position and given modifications if you need them.  You can always find a class that fits your schedule and none will disappoint.

{"text":"I love Forest Park. I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them."}
{"text":"I can't knock the food, because it's pretty good albeit overpriced. The whole host\/waiting\/seating situation there is ridiculous! I get that you want the \"entire party\" to be there before seating would-be diners, but you don't need to be a complete a$$ about it.\n\nI had a party of 3, waiting on 2 more people, we knew we would have to wait to be seated but the host seemed like he would seat our partial party if we came back in a few minutes once the table was cleared.\n\nIt was freezing and pouring that day and we didn't want to be one of the many annoying people that crowd the entry, so we hung out outside. About 10 minutes passed and our youngest diner (17) went into the door to see if we could possibly sit. As SOON as the kid went in through the door, the host freaked out and told him to go back outside.\n\nI thought that this was an extremely inappropriate way to talk to anyone. We were bringing in a party of 5 to drop at least $100 on breakfast. We left and got breakfast at Acme Cafe, and banned Medina in the process."}
{"text":"Is there an option for no stars?\n\nI am a university student (obviously) and I eat here quite often. I commute 1.5 hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch -- so Subway is always the best bet. Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. It's actually quite perfect.\n\nThe reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!?\n\nI would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper. Ayyyya."}

The fire is cozy, and it's often possible to get good deals through Groupon or their direct text deals.\n\nThere are a few dishes that I would not recommend - the salmon on the cedar plank was quite dry the one time I had it.  And the smoked platter was not my favorite.  That could be personal taste, though.\n\nGreat Happy Hour, but can be crowded unless you show up early..."}

{"text":"I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!"}
{"text":"Very nice Ambience, Service was great and Food is Delicious! My husband and I love Indian food and this is our first time here and what a great first impression for this place! Love it and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous resort.  My girlfriend got a great deal for a non-savanna view room.  Upon check in I asked if it was possible to get an upgrade.  They accommodated and gave us a room overlooking the savanna, near their farm.  What a great view!  Early in the morning it seemed like every animal on the property would flock here.  The resort itself is absolutely beautiful.  Each evening we would just wander around.  We ate at Sanaa and Boma.  Both were great, but after 2 nights, I was ready for some non-African food.  The only downside is that the resort is far from all the other resorts and parks (except Animal Kingdom) though taking the buses was convenient."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing to brag about. Small portions. Won't go back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I got takeout of house Lo Mein, bamboo shoot in chilli oil, mapo tofu with pork, Jin's schiuan beef, slice roast beef tendon and crab Rangoon.  I was very disappointed with their Lo Mein. It's like they just boiled the noodle and mix in some soy sauce. I was really looking forward to that wok smell. The bamboo did not have enough chilli oil. I thought the Sichuan beef and the beef tendon and the tofu dish were authentic because of the Sichuan peppercorn."}
{"text":"First time here at D'lites. I had the chocolate pretzel ice cream and my daughter had the title cheesecake ice cream. They were both very good. Flavors weren't very distinguishable but tasty in their own right. It was really just as good as many other soft serve ice creams i have had and at only 50 calories a serving and no sugar, I was impressed. There was a fun toy ice cream stand for my daughter to play with and a chalk board wall with chalk for her to draw on.  All in all a great no guilt treat, especially for the summertime. I'll be going back :)"}

{"text":"Delicious and nutritious!  Came here late Tuesday night and ordered the ceviche chalupa. Party in my mouth, seriously!  The chalupa stayed crunchy even though I dumped the whole side of salsa that it came with on it.  I loved how it was made. They did not skimp out on the ingredients.  I was full after one! I also had the black tea which was perfect on a TX summer night.  For the price, quality, and really the most important thing--the taste, I'm sold!   Bufalo Bob, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The staff is excellent and they have a deep knowledge of wine and food. It's a great place for special occasions and we saw several birthdays being celebrated. The food was good, but a few items were a bit bland for my taste. Be in no rush and bring several dollars, it isn't cheap nor would you expect it to be."}

{"text":"I've never taken to social media to review before now. The Salem, MA location has terrible customer service. I'm livid with my treatment. A few days ago, my order was over an hour late, arrived cold and the driver forgot the receipt. For my trouble,  I was told that my next order would be free. I just phoned to take them up on that, and I was told there was no credit in their system for me. I am too failed by this location. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business. SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY! Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable. A free side order? Not good enough! I'm a disabled,  housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today. I've never experienced such deplorable service from Domino's. I've been a loyal customer for over 20 years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts.  I'll never do business with you again. I'm writing corporate as well. I don't taken being mistreated well. It's unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time with this place. I been a member since 2014,  at the Hillsboro location and had amazing Brenda work on my facials. I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.\n I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY here."}
{"text":"I went to Bob's on Friday for some take out with my friends. \n\nI walked inside and immediately noticed the small market charm along with a rich aroma of Italian food. \n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful. I ordered a jumbo chicken cutlet parm sandwich. The bread was soft and warm....it was also filled with a generous portion of meat, cheese, sauce etc. at an extremely low price. Overall.....delicious.\n\nI wish I could give 4 1\/2 stars instead of 4, but the only complaint I have that Bob's has a very small bakery selection. If ownership ever looks to expand, I would suggest having a full bakery counter with all sorts of Italian pastries. This would make Bob's untouchable!"}

It's like a milkshake with a super sweet fruity flavor, drools!\n\nThis location serves up food and apparently a lot of bad rap music. They have a decent amount of seating but it is almost always full, I find it too loud in there but it's perfect for grabbing a delicious beverage to go!"}

{"text":"There are tons of froyo places in Austin, but this one is definitely noteworthy. The texture of the yogurt is perfect and the flavors are pretty diverse. They are pretty good about rotating flavors, but makes sure to keep the classics. They also do seasonal flavors which is really nice and during Christmas time introduced different flavors every week or so. I thought it was a nice touch to keep things different and add a little flare. It also kept me wanting to come back each time to try the new flavors! Toppings are also nice and fresh. The sizes are great, which I only point out after visiting another place and wishing I could cut the toppings in a quarter of their size. They also have a rewards program that gives you a few free ounces almost every other time you visit. It's worth looking into - the program even has an app!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town at Universal and wanted to skip the chain restaurants and Theme Park food...we decided to try this place out and were not disappointed. Authentic Mexican food and friendly homey environment. Will definitely be back our next trip to Orlando."}

{"text":"Will never go back to any toys r us. I'm not sure how this this location is still in business. Every time I shop here I leave wishing I never walked in. The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.  I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store. This place suxs the life out of you!"}

Great service and great quality!  I have been coming here for a few years now, and have never been disappointed.  The owner is very warm and friendly and her prices are extremely reasonable.  She specializes in weddings and quinceaneras, and can do anything from intricate formalwear to hemming a pair of pants.  Every time I come in, I feel like I'm talking to a long lost friend."}
{"text":"Michael and company are fantastic! All the beer is tasty and fair prices on everything. All the comments on here about the hours and dogs. It's a functioning brewery first and foremost run mainly by Michael and his wife so the hours reflect that. I know some want to tear it up into the wee hours, but this place is what it is a brewery. And the rules about dogs aren't the owners rules they are the states so if you have an issue with that take it up with your state legislature."}

{"text":"Nice pub ambience, on the small side with just a few seats at the actual bar itself.  Comfortable booths, several tables and chairs.  We arrived at around 1:30 on drizzly Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of seating available, so we grabbed a booth.\n\nInstantly attended to and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  I don't know what probs other reviewers had, but we had none.  \n\nWe enjoyed the Proletariat Red, simply delicious and not too hoppy, not too sweet...just riiiiiight.   \n\nI had the chicken ciabatta club sandwich and Mother Mary was it delicious!  Thick salty bacon, freshly grilled & slightly smoky chicken breast, sliced red onion and all the fixings on a warm and chewy ciabatta roll - which was a carb lover's wet dream.   Chose the tomato soup (oh how I wanted those fries but alas, the starchy carbs of the ciabatta roll cancelled those out)....\n\nMy compadre enjoyed a Blue Cheese burger or something of that sort.  Had mushrooms and crumbled bleau cheese on his beef.     I know he thoroughly enjoyed it  because he had visible and audible Foodgasms -  moaned and groaned through his entire meal.   He then emailed me later to tell me how fantastic his food was and can we please go back there soon!?\n\nIf you're ambling around Westmoreland\/Sellwood (this is not technically Sellwood - but whatever)  and you're hungry, stop in here for sure.  Great little neighborhood pub!"}
{"text":"Always suspicious of getting royally screwed when it comes to household repair calls, but this company is perhaps the best we have ever dealt with.  Courteous phone staff who take the calls and promptly get a repairman out and the repairman was so great.  He quickly analyzed the problem with our dryer and soon had the part in and we were up and running with a reasonable service fee.  Couldn't recommend this company enough.  Big 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here Monday with a Gilt city deal and ended up trying a whole lot more! The oysters and bottle of muscadet which was the deal were delightful. Next we ordered the plateau which was nothing short of magical and oustanding. The ceviche was on point, perfect level of acidity with sweet peppers and gorgeous fresh fish. Not a fan of the littleneck clams but that's just a personal preference, however, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, a classic and a goodie. The dressed lobster with loads of fresh herbs was heavenly and the char-grilled octopus with green chili's and blistered snow peas I could probably eat for the rest of my life. The octopus was so tender and rich and the peas and peppers added a necessary brightness that elevated the entire dish. The service was fantastic, very friendly, welcoming, quick and knowledgeable about the menu. No complaints about the automatically added 20% tip. If you don't like it, don't go out to eat! We would gladly return!"}

In the Prado, this has an outdoor area that we used (I am part of the GW alumni network here in Atlanta).  You're kind of on display for everyone walking by, if you're okay with that.\nWe had standard bar food and it was fine - humus, fries, shrimp, etc.\n\nNote: the restrooms are like the ones at One Midtown Kitchen.  Unless you notice and know that the red lights on or off outside of them means that they are occupied, you will yank on the door and try to open locked doors (and probably have the user nervously clench inside)."}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional! I came in to upgrade my phone. They did not have the phone I wanted even though it is one of the most popular phones. They said they would have to get it from another store. The employees left me sitting there for over 30 minutes while they joked back and forth with each other. Supposedly they were doing something with my account but did not communicate with me at all. They could not locate my account even though I have a Fido number and online account. I finally left the store as parking was expiring. Go to a real Fido store as previous reviewer suggests."}
{"text":"\"We'll cross that bridge when we get there.\" But what if we need to cross a bridge just to get there? I'd cross a mountain to get to Sapporo. \n\nMomofuku and Baohaus have ruined Pork Buns for me, and I never thought I'd find decent ones in Boston. But at $5.50 for two, Sapporo's are a steal. And better than decent. Done deal.\nMiso has never been my favorite, but the Spicy Miso Ramen gives me a run for my money. Soft, dense grains of the white stuff glide down your throat, and if you add a red-hot kick of chili, you really start to taste the spicy ground pork. Yum.\nI've had no broth more perfect than the Kimchee Ramen with its chewy al dente noodles. The kimchee packs some punch, and an addition of spicy ground pork is just perfect.\n\nI never want to go to Porter Square, but it takes about the same amount of time to get to as Allston's Super 88, the only food court that rival the Shops so if you say Sapporo I'll come running. So keep up the good work Sapporo, I think you also put Lesley University on the map."}

{"text":"Kinda a pretentious strange dive bar. Full of lots of office jocks, and scantly clad plastic looking, women, good beer selection, good happy hour, terrible terrible food. \nPlease do yourself a favor a skip eating here. Wings were just bones no meat at all. Seems like they were over fried and re fried. Slow cooked chicken was just Safeway roasted chicken with some day old bread toasted. In no way what so ever worth $16, a complete waste of money, no quality check. \n\nServer was running around like a mad person, not really doing anything, then she would disappear for 20min at a time.  I'm not really sure what was going on with her. Then she was pissy when when we were ordering from the bar.\n\nDecent live music a bit to loud for the time. Emptied pretty quick once the musician started. He was good just to loud."}
{"text":"Yes, it can be pricey.  However, if you watch the store flyer it actually has some pretty good sales (especially on coffee beans and seasonal fresh fruits).  \n\nThe store has a nice bulk bin selection for nuts, dried fruit, snacks, and candy.  I am addicted to the flax-infused corn chips.  As a gourmet store, you will find interesting goods and high-quality produce.\n\nThe deli and cheese counter offer a wide array of delicious goods.  Always make sure to ask for a sample taste before buying.  The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nAnd for any potential shoplifters, be warned -- they do watch you.  On my last visit, the police were removing a cuffed offender from the store ;-)"}

{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food in town. I'm not used to Indian food costing more than $20 so the prices were quite shocking. I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\n\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \n\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \n\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!"}
{"text":"Probably one the best patio restaurant's in Atlanta. All of the gays and lesbians come out and drink til they are merry on this perfect patio in midtown; but don't let that deter you if you are straight, it is an equal mix of people, believe me! The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning. The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!!\n\nThe beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5. There is regularly trivia, and there is always some reason to stop by Joe's. During the warm months, it is very hard not to just say, \"why don't we meet at Joe's?\", because it is the place to be. Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay. This is definitely a place that you will want to check out, for it's chilled atmosphere, the welcoming flair, and well, the whole package! You are bound to see me there, as we love to go to Joe's!"}
{"text":"I went here some time back and did not find much 'resistance' to anything Establishment by the main guy here.   In fact, I found the views about the US made 'drug war' in Colombia seemed almost to parallel that of the US government.     It really was totally disappointing.     The place definitely is not the center of any sort of  rebellion\/ political resistance that I could see."}
{"text":"Chill spot.  Lax atmosphere.  It gets smokey..."}
{"text":"Best in Boston is right! I love Le's. \n\nCheap pho (around $7\/bowl) and such a great, chill environment. Service is spot on and super accommodating.The best part is that the pho comes out ridiculously fast. The broth is SO yummy and gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy. Generous amount of tripe and meat!\n\nThe #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl. If you have the appetite of a small bear like he does, I think coughing up an extra dollar for the extra big bowl is worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I didn't go back to this restaurant after they renovated.  I found negative comments more than positive on other sites review.\n\nWe made the rsvn at 12.30pm and waited for few mins then got seated.  I found they have quite a lot of dim sims but absolutely overpriced!!  S-3.68, M-4.38, L-5.38, SK-6.38, SLK-7.98, SKK-8.98.  You may only find 1-2 items are $3.68 and most of items are $5.38 even more.\n\nDeep fried Chicken knees w\/wasabi - it's so greasy and the wasabi looked like so artificial coz fluorescence color.\n\nSteamed Black truffle mushroom dumpling - Only mixed mushroom dumplings, there is NO black truffle mushroom inside.\n\nSteamed salted egg yolk custard bun- Buns were so big and egg yolk was bland.\n\nBeef tripe and tender pot - It didn't look good but taste good.\n\nSteamed beef balls - Very soft and probably marinated with baking power!!\n\nShort ribs and pork liver rice roll pot - Super greasy!!!  I only had a rice roll and it's oily!\n\nThis is regular dim sum place, such quality of food and poor service.  I will not recommend this place at all."}

My only complain is the gnats.\n\nStayed here for 2 nights in room 3233 - 50's section. We switched over from Caribbean Beach Resort to save some money. I suggest not booking a water view room - you will get gnats outside of your room that will get into your room. Be prepared to swim through a swarm of gnats getting to your room. We had some in our showers and the corners of the ceilings. To remedy this we lowered the temperature of the room since they do not like warm temperatures. But gnats are mostly harmless so we decided to keep our room. Overall, the room was clean (bed was made every night, new towels, new toiletries)."}
{"text":"It was my birthday so I wanted to do a date night with my husband. I am a child of the 80s and heard about this place and was eager to try it out.\nHubby and I arrived early, after reading reviews about waiting for spots to play these retro arcade games. We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches. For my birthday I was brought back to a decade I enjoyed thoroughly!!"}
{"text":"The positive: large restaurant right in the Tuttle Crossing mall. Decor is very cool, and restaurant was clean. Food was delivered piping hot. \nThe negative: service was exceptionally slow. Our server left a lot to be desired. It took her over 5 minutes to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came, and we were all ready to order, and indicated that to her. She just smiled  and walked away. Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware. We had to flag down a different server and ask her to get our server so we could get utensils. \nWhen she finally brought them she took our food order. \nThen we waited...and waited.... and waited.... 45 minutes before our food arrived. The restaurant wasn't all that busy. Other tables that arrived after us actually finished eating before we even got our food!\nWe ate very fast as we had to be somewhere at a certain time. Paid our bill via the ziosk. She came to clear our plates and we asked for a to go box. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring a to go box. We wound up being late for our activity due to slow service.\nAdvice: go there if you want got food and have a few hours to kill waiting for slow service"}

It used to have a wider draft beer selection but now it's just Bud Light and Miller Light (yikes).\n\nFor better draft beer go all the way across the airport down by United.\n\nThe sandwiches are also pretty bad, like the burger. Better off going to Thundercloud.\n\nBut I was there in late December and there were people with Airport contractor badges being shown around and being told \"it's always packed\" at such and such times. because it's right next to the Delta gates, which operate the largest planes to Austin (757).\n\nSo maybe it will be changing soon."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for my free birthday pizza on July 29th, 2016 in the afternoon after getting salad and soda. I saw a small cardboard box sitting on an inactive heating tray. I said it must be mine and got it. Angry that no one said my name at all while waiting all that time and left with my full bags."}
{"text":"Spectacular, one of a kind restaurant with an elegant, serene atmosphere. They have the best deals during September, as you can order the Magical Dining all you can eat option for about half off the original price. One of my favorite places for exquisitely made steak and simple but delicious desserts."}
{"text":"There are not that many places where you can dig in with your hands and some tools of shellfish distruction around the city.  Although this place is pricy, it brings back a piece of home where my family would sit around and pick at crab legs while we talked for hours.  \n\nWe've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out.  \n\nOld Bay Crawfish: 1  1\/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w\/ old bay. served w\/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  \n\nMixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w\/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  \n\nI've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.  Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to."}
{"text":"We made reservations over a week ago for a special occasion, we had heard negative comments but wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow. Dinner was very bland, no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat. After dinner we ordered desert and tea, while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren't ordering anything else (not knowing we had actually ordered desert). Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior. They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers. Very disappointing, will most likely not return. At the end, we went to pay the bill, they had already added 15percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else. Be smart and read the reviews, this place is just not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"The service we received was absolutely fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful for my 11yo daughter who is very picky."}
{"text":"Oh wow, yum.\n\nI went there last night and will definitely go back.  The ingredients taste so fresh and flavorful.  The place is really cute.  My only gripe and the reason for giving it four stars is the waitress service was lacking.  It took quite a while to flag someone down and I finally got one of the bus boys to take my order.  (I was starved!)\n\nIt seems they have a buffet.  I'll be back to try that one day.  At $13, it's the same price as most of the entrees and a great option for the indecisive like me."}
{"text":"I visited the Sam Adams brewery during a trip to Boston in September 2008.  It was much more intimate than I expected, as it is one of the largest breweries in the US.  It turns out that this is the original location, but more of an R&D facility currently.\n\nWe had to wait around a bit for the next tour, but it wasn't too long.  I was quite surprised to learn that Sam Adams was founded in 1984 (I would have guessed 1884, if those were my two options).  The tastings were good and we even got to sample a couple of new brews they were testing.  \n\nI haven't been to Harpoon, so I can't compare, but plan to check it out the next time I'm in Boston."}
{"text":"I went well out of my way to try the sushi here. Upon arriving, I quickly regretted it. The guy preparing sushi behind the counter was sniffing constantly. It was gross and made me concerned that someone sick was preparing my food. \n\nAgainst my better judgement, I ordered the pineapple roll. I was sadly disappointed. It had an unappetizing crunch to it, and it was small for the price.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was friendly, but not enough to make up for the food or ambience of the place."}
{"text":"I have been to Capital City when my regular mechanic is not available. They have fixed my head lamp, at no charge! turns out it was just unhooked (they said that sometimes happens with these Volvo's) They could have easily charged me for a new bulb, but they didn't. Their great customer service will definitely bring me back. That is what I love about my neighborhood shop. They are honest and friendly and will get the job done fast =-)"}
{"text":"I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\n\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w\/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\n\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b\/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way."}
{"text":"Went to Bosphorous 2 weeks ago with my sisters for lunch. I was actually looking forward to it because it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in park avenue. As usual, we ordered humus and bread. Since we were sharing, I wanted to scoop some humus and put it in my plate. As I was doing that I noticed hair, as it was inside the humus. I immediately put my fork down and waited for a waiter. He was new so his trainer deeply scrutinized the plate in front of us, not believing. He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would shed. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I didn't like the demeaning nature of this manager. I felt like he treated us like this because we were young because I'm pretty sure if we were older and looked different m, he wouldn't have all these excuses. \nWe ate our dinner, which was good and left. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Got my tires swapped a few weeks ago a and they were very friendly and nice. Went shopping right after and noticed the tpms light went off and gave them a call and asked about it and they told me to swing by and that they would check it out. Even though they were busy they still were able to check on my car. Very satisfied! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Their chile relleno en crema is one of Austin's best meals.  It's also one of the few places in town where you can get real interior Mexican food -- pepian sauces, ancho chile sauces, and deeply rich moles. I'm pretty indifferent to the atmosphere but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp, in the ATL for a day and we were looking for great chicken and waffles.  Took your advice and found the great unassuming little restaurant in a strip center that was absolutely #fantastic.  The Chicken and Bacon Cheddar Waffles was perfect,  perfect moist fried chicken and the waffle was just great.  We also ordered the southern breakfast and again ---- just perfect.  I consider myself a grits snob and these did not disappoint.  Creamy, no clumps and when I cut those fried eggs in, #omg.  #justsayin. On my next trip to Atlanta I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is for coffee geeks. Coffee was excellent. The selection of snacks\/pastries was fairly limited, to a couple of scones and cookies, perhaps because we were there late in the day around 5. Non-coffee drink selection for kids seemed to be limited to hot cocoa. Nice small space though for sitting around having coffee."}
{"text":"I was super excited to finally find a place serving california burritos. This place unfortunately did not really deliver what I was seeking; in all the wrong places.\n\nInstead of delicious carne asada it is way too greasy, instead of lots of crunchy fries it is soggy and greasy, way too little guac or pico.\n\nI will have to wait until next time Im in SD for the real thing, oh well at least they tried."}
{"text":"Where's the kimchi, Taco Box?\n\nI'd been wanting to try this bright yellow food truck for some time, especially given its tempting location in a gas station parking lot. I finally gave in on a Friday night, and as I was the only one there I thought it would be the perfect time for somebody to rob me at gunpoint.\n\nI got the Spicy Pork Taco Box. It's a huge taco accompanied by lots of noshes including iceberg lettuce in orange dressing, spicy wings, a mystery egg thing and two mystery fried things. The taco was merely OK, the wings set my lips ablaze, and the mystery fried balls in mystery sauce were amazing. Sadly, there was no kimchi.\n\nThis is a better option than Taco Bell, but hardly a destination."}
{"text":"Hit this up with a group of friends and it was awesome.  Good beef, good pork and a pretty solid mushroom burger coming from someone who doesn't usually dig on that hippy nonsense.  The fries are cooked perfectly and they are rocking truffle salt.  Truffle salt!!!  Good call.  Also, I think they make the fries out of Yukon Gold potatoes which is always the way to go.  Can't wait to be back to try out some more bridges."}
{"text":"Got my hair bleached and dyed for the first time here. I was really nervous at first because I had never bleached my hair before, but the staff were exceptionally helpful and explained all the pros and cons to allow me to make my choice. In the end, I still wanted to dye my hair pearl white. Note that I have black, Korean hair about as dark as it gets. I ended up bleaching my hair three times before dying it and it looks amazing! This was done 2 weeks ago and it surprisingly still looks super good. My hair doesn't feel damaged and I get complements for it all the time. Oh, and the cut? In my books, they are specialists when it comes to asymmetric cuts. I would highly recommend this hair studio and especially Han."}
{"text":"Really great pizza quality and toppings options. The crust is thin, light colored, and soft with dark, charred spots that tastes like it was baked in a very hot oven. The atmosphere is also really nice- our waitress was great as well. The reason for 4 stars, not 5, is because my salad wasn't too great. I just got the house salad and found it really oily and sweet. I also noticed other tables got bread to munch on before their food came, but we didn't get any"}
{"text":"So we decided to stop in to have a bite. And we made a wonderful discovery here. The Pizza was some of the BEST in town. Service was amazing and I think the waitress was named Mia? Location is E. Broad st. She was very sweet & keep us happy. Also we had drinks & more food & Desert YUM!!! We will be coming back for more and talked about trying the Lunch menu as well. \nLetting ppl know how great our 1st time was. Keep up the great work !!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star rating, I would. After my girlfriend got patted down before walking in, we sat down to have a couple of drinks at the bar. Once we got our drinks, the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down, not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything, etc. I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check. From there, it went further downhill...My legal name is William, but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William...like Joe for Joseph, or Bob for Robert, Dick for Richard, etc. Well, they wouldn't accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill. In all my years, I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected...and I mean never!! I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX. After all that, I just ended up paying cash, but this was in my mind terrible customer service! The place inside leaves a lot to be desired as well....small, unclean bathroom, etc. I would not recommend this place to anyone...there are much better places to go in that same vicinity."}
{"text":"I realize this place has good reviews, but I was not at all impressed.  One Dr. there is nice and the other is not so nice.  I was hoping to have the nicer Dr. but kept getting the other one and it was highly frustrating.  It is weird to not have any privacy and be out in the open with other people staring at you.  It seemed that regardless of what the complaint was, the Dr. would do the same exact procedure on everyone.  That can't be right.  If I had a neck complaint, he would do the same song and dance as someone that had a lower-back complaint.  I noticed this and thought it was strange.   I found it unnerving to have to have adjustments done while other people stared at me, but that's the nature of this open environment.  Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to try the new Gluten Free bun with a grilled chicken sandwich last Thursday. The GF bun was a little small  and dry and tasted just okay. The bun did crumble apart as I ate my grilled chicken sandwich. This is somewhat typical of GF breads. My fries were lukewarm. The store was clean and service was quick and friendly, so I'll be back to try the GF bun again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and well priced. The chef specials are always great. I love the Tom ka and the thai tea is my favorite drink ever. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants ever. A must try place in Louisville. Once you do, you'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Tiny little bar, but I understand there is an upstairs that has never been open when I have been a patron. I typically frequent bars\/restaurants on a Monday night, as I am a chef myself. \n\nHands down, best chicken wings in Boston. Monday they are 25 cent wings, lucky for me it's the day I always go. Meaty and juicy with a handful of different flavors. Also, they have a a 7 dollar coors light pitcher. You tell me where else in Boston you can get that! I'm still looking. \n\nMy only gripe is that the jukebox has been out of service for the past 6 months since I discovered this joint. \n\nAll in all, it's a nice little bar nestled on cobblestone streets between TD Banknorth Arena and the Italian North End. Definately worth checking out if you're in the area and looking for a snack and some cheap beer."}
{"text":"The server told us they won the Best New Downtown Restaurant Of 2017. Some delicious, gourmet-portion dishes. \n\nTheir hospitality was disappointing as we made reservations the night before for 8pm on a Tuesday and when we arrived the female server said our table wasn't ready and if we left and came back in 20 minutes she'd be able to push 2 small tables for our group of 4. She didn't seem apologetic at all.\n\nA male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table.\n\nWe discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere.\n\nThe server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back.\n\nIn terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction.\n\n$33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4\/5.\n\n$23 Duck and Anchovy Ragu, Lemon and Parsley was good.\n\n$4 House Bread and Butter, $19 Mixed Salami Plate and $23 Tagliatelle, Bolognese was okay but no different than anywhere else.\n\n$24 Nettle Risotto, Pecorino & Shaved Almonds was a 3 out of 5.\n\nAgain, some tasty dishes but tiny portions. The noise was also slightly too loud to the point that you'd have to ask your neighbor to repeat themselves. We still had a great time despite the reservation issue and unthoughtful service. There were 2 dishes the server cleared without asking if we were done. They only had a bite or two on there but these are gourmet portions girl! That's like a third of the dish! \n\nBill for 4 people that were still hungry after was $292.50 before tip."}
{"text":"My favorite place now in Beverly for casual dining.  The food is plentiful, attractively priced, and damn good. Surprisingly varied menu. The ambiance isn't overly sophisticated but is quite acceptable. \n\nThis place usually is not overcrowded: on some nights, though, there is live entertainment, so if you don't easily handle noise\/increased din, get out by 9:00pm.\n\nFull bar and full wait staff service.  Turnaround time for food orders is not too long.  Way above-average pub experience.  Great value, friendly staff."}
{"text":"What an awesome cool place!!!! Best grilled cheese ever. Had the crisp buffalo and my husband had the  melt. It's whim delight and nostalgia on a plate... must come!!!"}
{"text":"Rigatone and Steak.  That's all I have to say!!!! This place has some of the best food I've tasted in Boston!"}
{"text":"Over the years, I've had a burger here before and always thought it was good.  Recently, I set up a corporate outing here with over 100 people.  The appetizers were ok, but the entrees on the buffet were lousy.  Just before the dessert went out, someone pointed out a cockroach walking on the plates to me, DISGUSTING.  See picture.  They also \"didn't receive\" our first check, then they charged over $10k on our credit card without authorization.  We tried to sort this out, they told us to send another check and when they received it, they will credit our card.  Well, they cashed the check over a month ago and still no refund to us.  I will NEVER go here again and I will tell everyone I know not to as well."}
{"text":"Never again !!!\nFound a dead bug in a dish from the buffet!!\nWhen I showed it to the staff, the response was just a sheepish grin, no apology or anything.\nThey just don't care for the quality or health of customers."}
{"text":"Delicious low key spot. Enjoyed sat brunch. Had hash with egg, black cod fishermans stew abd orrechiette- all tasty. Sangria was a little bitter and served withiut fruit. Friendly service and cute atmosphere. Single bathroom so plan to wait. Would like to try for dinner since lunch is brunch menu."}
{"text":"Super awkward experience at front counter. The female employee seemed to complain once asked to do dishes or something, saying \"This will be the SIXTH time, SIXTH!\" Then she made my drink. \n\nI was sort of weirded out that she was having this conversation while I was standing paying for my drink, but blew it off. Then I got my americano and it's so bad! Disappointing on all fronts compared to previous experiences. Maybe this employee was having an off day, but I just wanted a delicious espresso."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza place in central Florida. \nAfter a recent trip to NYC I can vouch that A Touch of Basil is just as delicious and any of the shops I tried while there. Love it!"}
{"text":"Well if you are looking for a quiet dinner where you can talk to your family this is not the place for you. There is a party atmosphere is the restaurant in the evening. A DJ, dancers, and music fill the room with all kinds of eye candy that is lots of fun but in some ways takes away from your dining experience. While it is fun to get people dancing on table tops and throw cocktail napkins in the air at any given moment, getting your food on time is not as easy as it seems. After seating, it took nearly ten minutes to get an order of drinks. Another ten-fifteen minutes to get our order of food in and the time between seeing our waiter kept adding up. The food was good however, was not plentiful. A steak kabob wasn't on a skewer and only came with one grouping of meat\/vegetables. Bottom line, if you want to drink and have a good time at a bar type place the. Head here in the evening for appetizers and cocktails but if you are looking for a good dinner and conversation go someplace else."}
{"text":"They're pizza is great, authentic thin crust with fresh toppings.  They should be charging more then $2 a slice. Plus the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I am in love with this store!! Dropped in for a quick ring size and Joe was very courteous and designs some amazing pieces. I'm planning on going back with some stones and see what kind of explosion of creative genius can happen.\nAlso... If you need custom yard art, this is certainly a place to check out as well!!"}
{"text":"Hair snobs unite! This is the best place I know of in Harvard Square."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with Teela Taqueria.  I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?)."}
{"text":"We liked it when we went for dinner. So we went for buffet. Not much choice for vegetarians. Biryani has gone bad and not so good curries for naans. So we could not have biryaniz and breadz even though buffet was very expensive!"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced furniture and pushy sales staff, this is the place to go!\n\nI don't, so took my business elsewhere. \n\nAt least they did me a favor and let me know that they were scammers up front- among other things, every item I looked at was only going to be \"on sale\" for a few more days. Even the items that would be custom ordered.\n\nIf you're that awful before they take your money, just imagine what they're going to be like after the sale."}
{"text":"I ordered the avocado Margarita that they are famous for. I was not disappointed. It was super creamy and they add just the right amount of alcohol that creeps up on you! :) I also ordered the tamales- also were very delicious."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Burlington Marriott and ate at Summer Winter for dinner. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the lobster mac n cheese. We left so completely full and satisfied it was ridiculous. That was THEE best filet mignon I have ever had, hands down. It was seasoned perfectly, and cooked exactly at med rare as I requested. My husband raved about his mac n cheese, noting that they used a very tasty white cheese and the lobster was a large piece (1\/2 a lobster tail I believe) and very tender. It was a pricey dinner with drinks, but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The entrees at Sakura can be hit or miss, but the appetizers and sushi are consistently good. If you like spicy food, the fire on fish maki is great. The egg rolls may be my wife's favorite appetizer in Wakefield.\n\nAs a bonus, the delivery is unreasonably fast, so this is a great option if you are too hungry to wait."}
{"text":"This place is excellent and I'm glad we have it so close by in Clintonville. I have only been once so far. I had the thinly sliced flank steak w\/garlic and general tso's. Both dishes were the best I have had. Very fresh with a lot of veggies. I will definitely be back for more and to try the sushi and Thai dishes they offer."}
{"text":"Super slow service...don't go here for lunch if you're on a timed break!"}
{"text":"Great HH and reverse HH everyday, and all day on Sundays (includes select sushi, appetizers, and sake). Sushi is high quality, recommend lobster roll appetizer, crazy roll, spicy yellowtail, and tuna. Seaweed salad and miso soup are cheap and tasty too."}

{"text":"Unos is actually my favorite restaurant and yet it's come to this--a two star review.  This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble."}

It included the speech he was to give on November 22, 1963 in Dallas as well as a portrait painted posthumously over what was initially an image of his brother Senator Edward M Kennedy.\n\nThe building itself is an outstanding example of architectural excellence."}
{"text":"Animal Kingdom Lodge is a big beautiful hotel on the Disney property.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable, and the view of giraffes, zebras, and other exotic wildlife cannot be beat.  Jiko is maybe the best restaurant in disney world, and Boma had a great breakfast.  While Victoria Falls was great to grab a drink at.\nThe one problem I really have here is that it is a bit far from all the parks, except Animal Kingdom.  I have stayed here twice and enjoyed it both time very much, but I think my wife and I will try a different resort on our next trip."}

{"text":"I'll start off by saying that four stars here is generous. But it is for two simple reasons, the view is absolutely gorgeous and the ambiance is far above that of the Oasis. If you want a sunset dinner or cocktails overlooking the lake, Soleil gets four stars.\n\nNow for the bad news. The food is only three stars. The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.\n\nWith that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic! Perfect choice for cocktails at sunset, and makes for a great date night."}
{"text":"Service here is spectacular! \n\nOur family ate dinner here after an unsuccessful attempt to dine at Gracias Madre (their staff was out on a beach vacation...I WANT IN!). We were kind of bummed, but Tin Shed really brought our spirits up with their kindness, home-styled foods, and rustic vibes.\n\nIt was a cold night, and we were that annoying tourist family that requested to sit by the fireplace outdoors. They didn't have any indoor spots available. I loved the space. Our super sweet host told us that blankets were available should we need them--that's quality service in the ears of Californians. \n\nOur server was a tall down-to-earth boy who checked on us at the right times. We enjoyed some pints of local beer and literally licked clean all of our plates. Their food is veggie-friendly and there are options for everyone from burgers to salads. Tin Shed is also dog-friendly in the patio (and they offer dog desserts too!) and such a comfort-feel space. This place is a great place for family night or even for a chill date."}
{"text":"After having all the usual stuff we eat on vacations (chicken tenders, burgers, pizza, etc) this was a refreshing meal.  The food was good, not out of this world good but good.  Their version of chicken tikka masala needs some help but what do you expect when it is not an Indian restaurant.  The dumplings were amazing as well as the other more traditional Asian dishes.  The service was Disney quality.  Our son had fallen asleep just a minute before we got to the restaurant.  Instead of inconveniencing us by having us take him out of the stroller, they switched our tables so that we can leave him in the stroller and have him resting tableside while we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"We all loved the pizza. Wonderful flavor. Nice crust. The fettuccine Alfredo had way too much garlic for our liking (lots of chopped up garlic pieces!)  More than I had ever seen in a fettuccine Alfredo.  Won't order that again. Otherwise the portion size was nice. Too bad I threw most of it away."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.\n\nMy first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.\n\nOverall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports."}
{"text":"No complaints on my side. This pub's 2 star review is undeserved and probably given by those who expect everything served on a silver platter. Understand that Texas industry abides by a different standard and you shouldn't expect fake smiles and an after meal foot massage from your server and you'll do fine here. \n\nMatthew and I started with a round of drinks: a corona and a bloody mary. Coronas will be coronas on good and bad days, but I was QUITE satisfied with my airport bloody. Strong, thick, & perfectly seasoned, it was just what I needed before catching a plane. \n\nWe ordered some sweet potato fries, a plate of wings, and the potato soup. For the price we payed, we got plenty of food that was well prepared, and the kitchen didn't skip out on plenty of cheese and bacon on my soup. \n\nOur server, Tony, was dope. For a young guy, he took care of all ten tables in the pub real well. \n\nWe're headed home, but if ever stuck in Austins airport again I wouldn't mind stopping in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant- we come here very often on the weekends! I love the enchiladas with beef and the Guacamole.  The service is always fast and the staff is excellent.  Side note: they are very family friendly, they always accommodate us and our baby in his car seat."}
{"text":"At first my review was gonna be a mediocre 2 stars. However the service really saved them because I was honestly impressed. My friends and I were here to order drinks and apps, simple bites like chips and such. Our beers were fine, they were what you'd  expect. However when our duo chips (salsa and queso) came out, we were less than satisfied. The queso tasted extremely burned. Like as if it it was stewed a little too long, burned on the bottom and therefore permeated that burnt taste throughout. We told our server about it who stated that a few others had also complained about it. I happened to also order a fried chicken taco that was also served with queso...that also tasted burnt. In the end, I was impressed by how the manager and server approached the situation. We received a complimentary round of drinks which is the reason and multiple apologies. Mistakes happen, so it's how they handled the situation as to why my friends and I will be returning."}

I went back to Whiplash and got some individual braids. I found out that Mika is actually the OWNER and not the receptionist (sorry Mika lol). Kim the braider did an AMAZING job on my hair. I've been receiving compliments literally since I left the salon. The customer service is impeccable and the stylists are very professional."}
{"text":"I love ramen like a fat kid loves cake. I consider myself to be a ramen connoisseur of sorts. As far as flavor goes, Sapporo ramen is in the big leagues. The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot. There are a couple of things that bug though:\n\n1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the \"butter ramen,\" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded. That means you will have to share a table with someone, and this person or persons (it could be a whole family) will be sitting very very close to you. You will know about all their personal affairs by the time the meal is over."}
{"text":"Cautionary tale: If you go to this establishment on a busy night, you may wait almost an hour and a half for your food--with no explanation, no contrition and no attempt at amelioration. That was our experience at Olivio.\n\nThe food\/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality\/portion size. The bread\/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long.\n\nThe waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit.\n\nWe understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself\/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating.\n\nI was here several years ago and now remember being underwhelmed at the food\/value, now we have more reasons not to return."}
{"text":"This place gets \"nice neighborhood restaurant\" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I've had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  \n\nThe menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.  Rosebud is a good neighborhood restaurant and a viable options for all occasions."}
{"text":"Literally not a thing, anything at all,  in my order was right but they gave me enough food to feed an African Village for at least a decade so I can't complain.  I ordered for me and  my brother I got enough food to feed all of Angola very pumped.  If it's midnight and you drive thru they'll hook you up with basically the whole menu from what I gather.   They did charge me an extra 2 bucks from what it said on the screen tho so 4\/5 stars."}

{"text":"A cafe sister restaurant to the ever popular Chambar Restaurant, the owners are so smart. This place had a line waiting in front just for a table when we got there at noon, but luckily we only waited for about 10 minutes to get seated. I soon saw why as there's really only a few tables in the long narrow space.\n\nI like how the menu had a wide selection of breakfast selection, and the 3 of us each ordered a dish. \n\nI had this (straight from their online menu):\nSaumon Fume (served all day)\nOpen faced ciabatta sandwich. Fried egg, smoked salmon, caper cream cheese, sliced avocado, arrugula pepperdew and artichoke salad.\n\nIt was quite good! Cream cheese with the capers were a perfect pair, it would've been a bit healthier if there was less oil and salt. But overall, it was great. I would order that again.\n\nMy friends had:\n\nFricass\u00e9 (served all day)\n2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, arugula, applewood cheddar. Grilled foccacia.\n- She said it was quite good, served in a pan\n\nl'Omlette du Matin\nDaily selection of seasonal ingredients.\n- She said it was good as the beginning, but the flavours got too heavy and she couldn't even finish it.\n\nWould I come here again? Maybe not... one for lack of parking, two for long waits for a table, three for slightly high prices for just eggs\/salad\/tomato\/etc (but I guess they're in an $$$ location too). But hey, if you like that kind of stuff, check it out!"}
{"text":"This is possibly my favorite \"fast food chain\" per-say. Everything is amazing. The servers are always very nice are always willing to serve you more condiments if you ask for \"more\" of something. I especially love the the guacamole that they make at Chipotle. Although sometimes the servers don't fill up the whole container of you ask for it to be on the side or is completely fresh, it never fails to taste amazing. It's almost as good as guacamole in Mexico, but definitely the best in Oregon. It isn't a thick or watery consistency with the perfect size and amount of avocado chunks which makes it perfect."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing hamburgers.   First visit.  Thanks yelpers for a correct review.   Had to try the prime time burger.  OMG delicious.   Poblano burger very good.  Sunrise burger delicious.

{"text":"Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12\/09\/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done."}

Notice all those 50% sales at the mattress stores? Umm hmm.\n\n\nAnyhow, the old mattress had been caving in for quite a while and she finally started to share my opinion that it was time for as new one (I think when you have to climb out of the bed rather than off of it, it's past time). There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress. Everything done exactly the way it was agreed to. Perfect."}
{"text":"OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom.\n\nFirst, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar \/ pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\n\ngo Romer's!"}

{"text":"I'm not a food trough kind of person, and prefer quality over quantity.  It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.\n\nThere are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.\n\nIf you're in the mood to shovel decent meat in your face once in a while, give HomeTown Buffet a try again.  I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to write a bad review of this place for a couple of months now. Looks like I'm too late, since they are closing at the end of the month. I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didn't have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26\" rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles). I've worked in a shop before, and customers are the lifeblood of the shop - bummer this guy didn't realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under."}
{"text":"The queso we received for checking in was delicious, and the fajitas were pretty good. We went on a Saturday night, where it was super crowded and they were understaffed, so you could tell everyone was a little stressed. It was also a little much for a margarita that was just mediocre."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me of this new place in town. This self-served frozen yogurt shop has a greatly optimistic attitude fit for Portland. I felt good the first time I walked in and saw a green-yellow themed decoration with a number of great quotations about life and laughter all over the place. We were greeted with a sample cup to taste all those wonderful flavors of frozen yogurt. There are so many flavors to choose. My favorite is Chocolate Cake a la Mode. They say they will change the flavor every week so it's a good reason to go back there again and again. The options for toppings were even more fabulous - ranging from chocolate fudge to chocolate chip pieces to fresh fruit. I totally love this place. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Acquired by the very friendly and helpful new owner Tamie in May 2014, Med-Physique at 3 Graces now offers several new spa services, including Exlis, Botox, Juvederm, specialized peels, laser hair removal...as well as a variety of message styles to choose from and organic airbrush spray tanning...all in the newly remodeled spa facility. \n\nAlthough I loved my services provided at 3 Graces before, the space was indeed in need of a bit of a \"makeover\" itself. Great new facility and treatment options; however, I only visit for message or spray tans so I can't speak to quality of other services."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, we are vegetarian & British. We were limited to chips & we were fine with that. \n\nI ordered 4 portions of chips & got very delicious crisps. (Potato chips) we explained to the girl at the counter that we expected chips that come with fish, not fries. I guess we should have clarified but being in a fish n chip shop in a concentrated Brit tourist area I didn't think I needed to lol\n\nAnyways we paid for an additional 2 portions on \"fries\" & waited again. 2 more boxes came out with battered fries. Wasn't expecting that & although we just wanted plain old chip shop chips we did still enjoy. \n\nSo I suggest trying the garlic & Parmesan POTATO CHIPS & hopefully the staff can learn to double check what people mean lol"}
{"text":"My first Yelp experience was choosing movers and Precision Moving seemed like a great option.  From the Yelp review, to the website to the actual move, Precision Moving provided the BEST moving experience my wife and I have ever had (at least 6-8 moves between us).  Rudy, Gil and Jeff were professional, careful and efficient.  Although I haven't used all the Boston companies, I would say Precision Moving strikes the balance between cost and quality.  Easy 5-star recommendation."}
{"text":"I'll start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I haven't tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome."}
{"text":"This was a pretty big disappointment. We paid extra to essentially stay in the park (what would be normal hours any other month) but with Halloween decorations. All the attractions had hour and a half waits. \"But you can purchase an express pass to bypass the lines!\" Sorry, I don't like the idea of paying the theme park to get to the front of the line. Universal has good attractions, but it's like playing a freemium game once inside. They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions.\n\nThe scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though. It seemed most of the crowd was younger, too. We (30 year olds) felt a little too old for the event.\n\nThe best part of this was that Diagon Alley was EMPTY. We rode Escape from Gringott's twice in a row with no wait. All the shops which are normally shoulder-to-shoulder during the day had plenty of space to enjoy. We were able to ride almost every ride in the park twice with no wait before the crowds swarmed back in.\n\nIn short, worth it for the lack of crowds after 5 and before about 9, but lame Halloween gags targeted to teens and presented by teens."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The donuts are the best EVER. The girls that work here are super friendly and the deli is delicious. I don't live anywhere near this shop but I make special trips to get donuts, coffee, and scratch tickets nearly every Sunday. \n\nOh and they are open 24\/7."}
{"text":"Jesse and Ashley do an awesome job w gels and give the best pedicures. The place is just a little expensive but totally worth it.  Getting a pedicure as we speak....\nIt's so relaxing .... zzzzzzzz :)"}
{"text":"I stopped at black seed cafe on my way to the hotel room after a tiring 6 hour tour of the entire city and when i entered there was nothing on my mind but to get something to eat. There a lot of options you can choose from when ordering specially for the wraps. I ordered the Bahamas chicken hot wrap to try something out of the ordinary and it was delicious. Beside from having a lot of tomatoes in it, the zucchini and eggplant were well done and enhanced the flavor. If you ever go there let them know what to hold in your wrap so you don't end up with a lot of tomatoes on you plate in the end."}
{"text":"Ok, lets get through this. The pizza is on point. Its not the best in the world, maybe not the best in town even, but you cant go wrong with any pie on their list. \n\nGood service, good food, lots of parking, cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service and friendly staff!! Pancakes fluffy and patty melt very tasty!!! Wendy is fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"The pie is awesome! However, the staff is kinda rude. My party of 4, one of which was from out of town, showed up at 9:30 pm. We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out. The neighborhood was a buzz with people walking around. Other bars and restaurants were open and packed. I won't bother going back. I will take my business to Pix Patisserie."}
{"text":"Place seemed dingy and the food was meh at best.  The staff seemed friendly enough and the food came out in a decent amount if time.  I just couldn't shake an uneasy feeling like I was going to wind up with food poisoning (I did not get food poisoning) it just doesn't feel clean in there. I would not go again."}
{"text":"About Skyview (from their website):\n\"Towering nearly 20 stories above Centennial Park, the SkyView Ferris wheel features 42 climate-controlled gondolas providing guest with breathtaking panoramic views of downtown Atlanta and the surrounding metropolitan area. Those looking for an even more enhanced experience will enjoy our VIP gondola boasting Ferrari leather seats, glass floor and a longer flight time. And, with its convenient location just steps from many of Atlanta's most popular attractions, SkyView Atlanta is the perfect compliment to your downtown adventure.\"\n \nTook my ex on a date night of things that he loves. Skyview was something he had wanted to try out so I planned a visit during our night out. Adult tickets are $13.50 but they have military discount. And they let me apply the discount to both of our tickets. Cool. There was a line, but we got on the ride quickly. I was afraid that the ride was gonna be really quick since it was near closing, but it actually seemed like we were on there for a good amount of time. It was beautiful seeing Atlanta all lit up from the sky, but I wish I could have seen it during daytime. Guess i will have to go back."}
{"text":"Friends and I usually go here almost out of necessity - it's nearby and we are often given coupons. There are plenty of TVs, but it can still be a headache to catch a game here when the place gets so busy. Recently, we (a couple of 20 somethings) informed the hostess that we wanted to watch the Falcons game - she then sat us in a room only showing the Steelers game, right next to a table with two small children. I don't mind kids - but during football Sunday, I don't want to have to watch my language either. We moved outside in the heat and had to take a seat in front of a TV that's had a shady, black spot in the middle of the screen for months. Get that fixed, man.\n\nThe parking is particularly AWFUL. It can take 20 minutes to find a spot, and I've known many people who have had to park across the street at Marta and walk over. The food is just okay, the beer selection is good, and the service is iffy - it really depends on who you get."}
{"text":"Was curious about this place since before it opened when I noticed the large \"DINER\" lettering atop the building. \nAnd finally after more than a few weeks I had the opportunity to walk over and have breakfast. And it was a great time. Friendly staff, Jenn was a sweetheart. Concise and modern \"diner\" menu, and the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Nice brunch spot.  The berries and cream crepes was so good.  I also tried the summer in italy which is french toast with fruits which was also pretty good.  Ordered takeout this time but would definitely come back to dine in."}
{"text":"Went to the Reggae Brunch with a large group. We called ahead 3 days before to get a reservation but were told that if our party showed up promptly at 11 we would be seated without a reservation. We were assured that we did not have a reservation and everything would be all set. \n\nWe waited around as the hostess figured out what to do with us and said that no one would've told us this over the phone. Meanwhile, there were many empty tables and people waiting to be seated. Finally after 40 minutes and a mixture of possible seating combinations, we were seated together in the back of the restaurant. During our entire meal the restaurant had many empty tables, yet did not sit everyone that came in.\n\nThe waitress came right over and took drink orders. Beyond this though the service was awful. I did not get my meal until all the other 12 people in the party were almost done eating. The check was wrong and the promise of removing drinks\/my meal from the bill was not done. At this point we were ready to just get out of the restaurant and it took another 30 minutes to get the bill situated as it had been miscalculated between cash and cards. \n\nThe band was the best part! They were great but the food was mediocre and service was awful. Most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Dinky place, big taste!  If you want some traditional and great Chinese food you can find it here (note the roasted ducks with the heads still attached and you know you're in the right place).\n\nTry their BBQ pork, Chaxaw pork, BBQ cuttlefish, crispy skin pork, and the dishes they have written on the menu on the wall.  The flavor is great, just like Chen's down the street.  Place is small so I usually just do take out and eat at home but the flavor is not the same as if you dine in since they do something to the dish in the back (adding different type of sauces) which make the food taste batter (plus they heat it up).  Try the noodles and wontons also, it's pretty good, but I rather have other type of noodles instead of yellow egg noodles).  \n\nIf you like Chinese food and want something different than typical take out places then this is the one you have to try!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty OK there, but the service was good. One thing I really felt cheated is the ordering of the table side guacamole. We have 5 people in our party, when we placed the order for the guacamole, the server asked us since we have 5 people, do we want to have one more avocado for the guacamole. We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday, had one of my worst experiences at a restaurant, and joined Yelp just to write this review.\nI went with my girlfriend for dinner during mid-week and found the place doing decent, though not busy, so we were at least seated promptly. Everything went downhill from there.\nWe started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. \nDo not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location)."}
{"text":"We came here for Dine out Vancouver. Awesome service, they were very accomodating and we had a  great dinning experience here.  Will come back again to try out their regular menu"}
{"text":"Its no 99 cents only store, but its a decent dollar store... \n \nDon't park in the lot where the Starbucks\/FedEx is (which is the SAME building)-- I was the dollar tree for 10 minutes and I got a 34$  ticket...  made my dollar store experience pretty pricey. They apparently validate for the underground garage around the block."}

I came from DC and I'm a stickler for costumer service! All of the drinks were hand crafted and strong! The manager explained the entire system and business bc I was honestly confused why there is NOT one in DC, I even offered to invest in one... Yes, it was that amazing!!!! I recommend the duck taco or bowl & the pork belly!!! Again, amazing spot and my new ATL favorite!!"}

{"text":"I am not a customer here, but as a healthcare worker I come here frequently as part of my job.\n\nI can say that this is one of the worst medical centers in the city. Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients. \n\nThe staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people. \n\nThis place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County. Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients. \n\nDo yourself and the staff at DMC a favor. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed to say the least. I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\n\nOur waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \n\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\n\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. \n\nThis place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today.  It's not bad but nothing to get excited about.  Interesting mix of choices, mostly Mediterranean themed.  They have a nice display of their fresh salads and other choices. \n\nI had the Tabbouleh with gyro meat which was actually pretty good.  The sauce needs more flavor.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the location is convenient.  Just a head's up, a lot of day laborers hang out in the parking area because of the Home Depot nearby."}
{"text":"So, line up outside the door, but plenty of clean and empty tables inside. Waltz up to the hostess to be ignored... Charming. Told 15 minute wait, sure thing, we'll head to a store nearby for a look and come back shortly. Again, empty tables everywhere, but still a line up out the front. Ordered food, said food was delivered to the table. Wait staff only barely able to muster up enough 'customer service' to scrape by...\n\nI made the mistake of ordering the shrimp... Spent the rest of my Saturday in the bathroom throwing my insides up. Pleasant. Needless to say I will never be back, as I've since heard other horror stories from other patrons at various other Max & Erma's.\n\nLift your game. I don't like having a New Years long weekend destroyed by a third rate meal and then the after effects of what can only come down to poor kitchen practices. I should probably report this establishment to the appropriate authorities."}
{"text":"I purchased my tank from The Wet Spot about 10 years ago. This tank was very successful - most of the fish living for a very long time. We decided to add live plants and a couple new fish about 3 years ago. That was the last time I was there. Customer service at that time was severely lacking and almost all employees seemed rude\/agitated. Maybe you could blame that one on the severe humidity in the place - it's almost unbearable.\nWe wandered in there yesterday, the whole time my bf muttering under his breath about how he didn't want to be there, didn't want to deal with anyone's shitty attitude, and thought the place was overpriced.....\nI just wanted to test the water in our tank, add some new fish, maybe a frog and some cool plants. Enter Colby...... the MOST helpful, patient fish person EVER!! He tested the water, gave us suggestions to up the pH level and spent the next hour with us. He helped us pick out fish, lights, plants..... He was Awesome.\nI'm so glad we decided to give them another shot. As long as Colby is there, we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, and I live 300 miles away.\nStopped in the first time a week ago and I had the Guru Rice while my wife had Noble Broccoli...they were both awesome and we left totally full. Power combo of flavor and portion size with these dishes.\n\nThen today we were swept back to Portland on the trade winds and decided to stop in with our friends. everyone enjoyed their food. we even shared around. even our non-vegan friend loved his food...so this place is a win."}
{"text":"This place is truly exceptional! \n\nMy big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \n\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential for a family adventure.  Monster Trucks, Orange slushies, cheesy decorations galore.  But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide.  \nPart one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. \nCritique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. \nCritique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \nPart two in the store:\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\n\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review."}

{"text":"Popped in one night about an hour before Closing. Found out ,with a stamped ticket, Parking is free for 2 hours. A, plus. Stood in line for about 15 minutes, then the door matron let me in, to stand in another line(very long). Was chatting with a couple in line and, one of them said you can sit at the bar and get quicker service. So I sauntered over to the one remaining seat. The bartender was friendly, took my order. Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked. Got out for around $16."}

The beer only cost 3 dollars! And it was a local microbrew that made me happy. Beer always makes me happy though. I've been told this place is best for breakfast, but I guess I'll have to wait till next time!"}

So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back."}
{"text":"This is fantastic! We had cold lobster rolls and shrimp burgers at our server Amy's advice. She was spot on! The grilled octopus and fish dip as appetizers were worth the fuller belly than we planned!  Again, Amy came through when we asked what to dip the homemade chips in. My hubby and her discussed what he liked and she actually went back and mixed her own dip of horseradish, Old Bay and mayo, and we basically dipped EVERYTHING in it! We could not be happier with Amy or our stop here!"}
{"text":"Very Bad Service......\ni have been using this car wash for couple years, only doing exterior and driving it my self, through out last year i have been noticing how rude people are there, but i never interacted with them, until recently when i decided it to use full service, so i gave them my car then i went to the other end waiting for, once it came out i notice it the person who is driving it can not open the door from inside, so i opened it from outside then i realized that they  broke then handler from inside, so i asked for a manager, and when he came i was trying to explain to him the situation but what shocked me is that from the beginning he was to aggressive with and he does not even want to listen to me, so i realized that this guy is no gooooood, by the way i am a regular customer so when i told him that, his answer was take your business, his argument was that things broke, and we are not responsible for them.\n\nthe sad thing i called there office which is located in Malden, guess what the woman who is responsible for taking complaints is never available. \n\ni used to spent at least $200 every month there. Not Any More.\n\nif i could i would rate it zero star."}
{"text":"Service,  Sat with 2 friends at the bar. Craig was great.  Knowledgeable,  friendly and funny.\nFood,  Calamari and Brescetta to start....both great.  Entrees; Veal Marsala, Salmon,  Veal spinach ALL GREAT. Can't say enough."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit Pabu twice last week - first before a show then again to celebrate a birthday dinner. \n\nEach visit the staff was attentive and cared about our experience. On my second visit they remembered me by name! \n\nWe did the omakase at the sushi bar (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and our personal sushi Chef Ray along with Chef Brian gave us an amazing tasting of nigiri while showing us and explaining each special treatment of the fish. All of the staff, including the management, stopped by to say happy birthday and check if we needed anything. \n\nthis is my favorite place for Japanese cocktails. Each time I went back to the Classic Lolita (Japanese Old Fashion) and Porco Rosso (named after my favorite cartoon character!).\n\nWhether or not you're looking for an authentic Japanese tasting or picking plates from the never disappointing a la carte menu Pabu is the spot to dine."}
{"text":"Wow seriously Starbucks! Get with it!! Not only was the drive thru lady extremely rude on April 1st at 12:00pm but my coffee was not even full! If I wanted a half a cup of coffee do you think I would come to Starbucks!? I will NOT be coming back to this location. If this was an April Fools joke some future advice... don't mess with someone's coffee! :\/"}
{"text":"I cant tell you how much I love Hertz and its #1 Gold Priority Service.  Hertz makes it so easy to get to your car, and leave!  I never have to wait in line filling out paperwork I have already done online.  Get off the plane, find my number, go to the exit and already on my way.  Pricing is never much more and most the time cheaper than what the other places will nickel and dime you.  The time you get back not waiting in line for them to assign you a car is worth so much more.  The kids are already antsy from the flight, throw them in the car and get on the road to a happy vacation!"}
{"text":"This was one of the few physical therapy places in the Boston area recommended to me by Massachusetts General Hospital for help with a broken wrist.  It was great in all aspects, and I would also highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not as expected  Room cleaning service not so good lots of dust.  children diving & swimming in hot tub.  Floats of all sizes allowed in pool, lots of kids splashing.  No TV when it rains.  Looked like free summer camp. Saw 2 women with 15 kids.  I counted them twice.  Loud disrespectful kids all over the place. Not a place to relax. The beds have the worst mattresses.  5 nights, room cleaned one time.  Maid service comes late while we were back in room.  Shuttle bus to Universal.  We had to take a cab."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend here the other day on a sunny afternoon. First of all, I love the name of this place. I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!"}
{"text":"Got gel mani and opi pedi. The pedi was great! Loved it. \nHowever, the gel mani wasn't very pleasant -- the surfaces are uneven; got gel on my fingertips; top coat got on my index finger and a small part of my skin was burnt under the nail lamp... Hurt a lot \n(well, maybe it was because they were doing my mani and pedi at the same time, and the leg massage made my hands moved? )"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and had the best experience. The food was amazing and fresh, the service was excellent. The two people serving us which we think might have been the owners were so friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I come here for dinner with a bunch of friends every now and again. Beer list is good, fried pickles are tasty, and the staff is generally stellar. I've been happy with the grilled cheese and club sandwiches I've ordered. Once we came here and there was an embarrassing bro cover band, but I don't think that is a regular occcurance. \n\nPrices are good and this place adds a much needed casual but nice dining option to Malden."}
{"text":"Small food court, but you come here for the beignets.  Its not the best, and by far not NOLA, but its still a treat.  I wish they had better coffee to go with the beignets.\n\nFood wise, its ok.  Service could be better.  Many of the workers have an attitude. Not sure if they really don't want to be working there, or, if that's the attitude of the \"south\" or New Awlins types.  Whatever.  Don't need to give me attitude when I'm confuseed what's considered a snack point or an entree! I'm a tourist with a food plan, not a local regular.\n\n3 stars for the service, and perpahs the lack of selection for a food court.  Riverside, just down the walkway, has more variety, but no beignets."}
{"text":"Came with the family on a saturday nite. Service and food was great. It was a little pricey for what it was but the live music made up for it. im not usually a fan of live music at resarsunts but this was great! Cant go wrong with johnny cash and Willie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Austin, and I frequently use it to give people a sense of what Austin is all about. It's like the hippest backyard you've ever been to. It's very laid back, and a little bit out of the way. They have an Italian food truck in the back called Patrizi's that is developing a really good, and really well-deserved reputation.\n\nNow that they have a full bar, I can't imagine a better place to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"Hate to say this but they leave the food on the warmer over heated and soggy. It's not like there's a lot of people by 1:45pm but Christ people will be eating what they paid for! Yup that's what I had, a soggy string beans and broccoli. Yuck! Do a better job please!!!"}
{"text":"I've had ramen from Japan to New York and places in between. The ramen was way too oily. Pretty gross, actually."}
{"text":"It's close, it's not quick, but it's easy to get to and have lots of lunch and dinner options.  Breakfast on the other hand had pretty limited options. It's a quick service food court. You really can't expect much."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for Italian in Vancouver. My only criticism was that there needed to be a few more pasta choices.  I also thought that I prefer my meatballs mildly herbed and they were a bit too spicy for my linking. In spite of the few shortcomings it was a nice find and I'm amazed I hadn't eaten here before tonight. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Passport services are on the 2nd floor. You can take the stairs just to the right of the main entrance to the International Office or take the elevator from inside. I arrived at 8:10am to have passport photos taken. I was out of there within 10 minutes with photos in hand. There were two families queued up for actual passport services. Since I just needed passport photos, the receptionist took the photo and processed my payment. There is a separate counter for processing passports and ESL services. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Ciao!\n\nHere on. Tuesday at 6pm.  The staff, cuisine and ambience was wowza wowza!\n\nGreeted and seated immediately and couldn't have been more friendly.\n\nWe ordered soups, dinners off the daily menus.  I had the mushroom penne, side of meatballs.  Hubby had the chicken cacittoria.  All excellent.\n\nBiscotti' for dessert.  $52\n\nWe will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it, just couldn't. \nSeafood tasted frozen and freezer burnt - nothing was even edible. \nWe left hungry and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Very slow prepping, and the food tasted very bland. Overall pretty disappointing experience. I wish they would have the regular menu at lunch. Maybe their regular pasta would taste better but I won't be back to wait another an hour to try"}
{"text":"Great place to eat German food and drink German beer, and it won't make a hole in your wallet.  The only thing negative is the neighborhood.  If your dinning here at night, please be aware of your surroundings."}
{"text":"Came to Wonder Spice with a friend who grew up going there. The two servers we had were very friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious! They heard me talking about how I'd had a certain dish spicy somewhere else and offered to make my meal spicy. Big portions and a comfy atmosphere-great for lunch or dinner--reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese food. Have gone here 3 times already since they opened barely 2 weeks ago. They're so nice and friendly, and the food is amazing. My partner is strict vegan as well and there were plenty of options."}
{"text":"Gave it a try... twice. Shame on me. Not very good BBQ. Unfortunate as I live across the street.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Le's is always a win. I've been gong here with my family for many years now and have never had a negative experience. My favorite dishes are lemongrass chicken and any of the wide-rice noodle dishes. What makes both of these dishes great is the flavoring. It's hard to describe precisely, the best way to explain is just that  they get the flavor right here."}
{"text":"My house is two blocks from here, and it's taken me this long to try Sauced due to the mediocre reviews found here, as well as word of mouth. Based on my experience last night, my concerns were unwarranted. \n\nDined with a friend, and we shared; \npork cracklins - delicious, perfectly fried, seasoned well, and way bigger serving than I expected, \nblack-eyed pea fritters - delicious, perfectly fried, larger than I expected (Asian chili dipping sauce good, but the others were meh), white bratwurst - not my cup of tea, so I shouldn't speak to this one,\ncaesar salad - very enjoyable, grilled effect was quite nice,\nskewer trio (selected brisket, chicken, & shrimp) - this was quite a mediocre dish, came with weird uncomplimentary sauces, only thing I had that I wouldn't recommend.\n\nPS This was way too much food, we totally rolled out of there. My plan is to return with my man, have a couple drinks, some pork cracklins and black-eyed pea fritters, and call it a night.\n\nOn the drink side, the menu was nice. Turn the page to get past the $10 house cocktails, as the second page has the $6 ones. I had a Harvey Wallbanger, quite nice. My friend had a sazerac which he enjoyed.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience. Total tab was $55. The decor was comfortable, not at all as overwrought or kitschy as I was expecting. We sat in the back on the rounded booth which was quite comfortable. The noise level was very acceptable until just before we left when the place was packed, about 8:30pm on a Thu. And Ria was playing hostess. She was extremely welcoming, and gave us our pick of table.  \n\nI consider this a great addition to the hood. And I'm looking forward to coming back, sitting on the front deck, having a cocktail, and enjoying the street scene."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go, kick back with friends, and eat some good food. No - it's not 5-star high end cuisine. No - it's not an up-scale trendy pick-up bar. But it's also not TRYING to be any of those things. \n\nIt HAS a bar, but it's for local friends to chill, catch the evening news, and have a drink. It's not the spot you are going to find your new European Super Model Wife. But they don't claim that you will. The bar is not the main part of this restaurant. The bar is just there so that they have one. The reason to visit is for some good food and to be in a relaxing environment with friends. \n\nBetween my husband and I - we've tried almost everything on the menu, and so far, we can't complain. The French Onion soup is a good, solid standard. I'm told to try the meatloaf (but my husband is a poopie-head, because he knows I don't eat beef). My personal favs are the club sandwich (minus the pork products) and their crab cakes. They also have really good onion rings. \n\nAll in all -- thumbs up. Stop on by."}
{"text":"There was only one flavor of bubble tea at that time so I guess I would get it sooner than I thought. The truth is the people who ordered after me got their drinks first, and one of them ordered the same drink. The cashier, who was in charge, I assumed, didn't feel sorry when I complained, and joked with the staffs who were making the tea in Mandarin. So I talked to her again in Mandarin, repeating what I said earlier in English, and she provoked me by telling her colleagues to ease and take their time to make my bubble tea. \nThe drink is ok. I could taste some taro in the milk tea so I could tell it wasn't just some flavored powder in it. But the service is the WORST."}
{"text":"First of all, to be frank, my friend's Power Pizza was served uncut. We were all very disappointed and astonished. Additionally, my other friend's Shrimp Fettuccine only had approximately five pieces of shrimp. Also, there was a paper table cover on the table but we were not supplied crayons for our pre-dinner rituals. Furthermore, my friend who is lactose intolerant received cheese on her Shrimp Fettucine. Finally, we asked for the check and received it about 6.9 minutes later. Overall, the experience was unforgettable and we made mems nonetheless. 10\/10, would recommend. \n\nP.S. Beautiful toilets!"}
{"text":"College Optical is wonderful!  They are always attentive and ensure that my prescription is up to date and correct.  Their selection of glasses is incredible.  At each of my visits, they spent time with me to pick out glasses, fit me for contacts and discuss my insurance benefits.  Not once did I feel rushed or unheard.  Most importantly Dr. Holland and the rest of the staff are always friendly, helpful and honest.  100% would recommend this business."}
{"text":"I ate here 4 times in my week in Portland. Partly because it was across the street from my friend's house but mostly because it was really good. \n\nThe oatmeal pancakes were really really good. And the short stack is still huge. Their organic syrups are super amazing."}
{"text":"I always avoided getting our carpets cleaned at our old house because it seemed like such a hassle, but I made a vow to do better in the new place. Several people on our neighborhood FB page recommended Peacefrog so I decided to give them a try. Called on NYE day and got a friendly scheduler who explained everything. The technician, Mike, arrived on time and worked quickly. He was aware of our cat and gave him a chance to hide before getting started. We had a pet stain that wouldn't come up and we weren't charged for the extra cleaning attempt. Carpet looks great and the whole thing (upstairs and stairs only) took about two hours, plus drying time. Good job! Definitely would use again."}
{"text":"Since this place is located near some decent hotels and in an okay looking strip mall, I thought I'd give it a chance despite other reviews.  I wouldn't expect the people I saw in here to stay in any motel other than one that rents by the hour.  The food was actually pretty good.  Hot and a decent selection despite the size.  Number one problem is the inside.  Run down, dirty carpets, a young girl sweeping right next to me as I ate.  Number two, and probably the biggest reason to avoid is the clientele.  The absolute dregs of humanity.  If the guy talking very loudly in his phone didn't bother you, you could have picked from the idiot playing Pok\u00e9mon as he went around the buffet.  Oh wait, when he wasn't playing, he was definitely not disciplining his child.  The little boy was screaming and yelling and he nor his wife did a thing.  If you need a boost to your self esteem, come here and discover there are much more people not deserving to live on this planet.  Feel good about yourself and thank the stars you aren't in this classless class of morons."}
{"text":"Car tint was installed by Sunbusters.  Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.\n\nI'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.\n\nIf you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great place.. good burgers.. surely like this one!"}
{"text":"Damn, I am so glad Henry's partner at Otto's told me to get the F- out when I asked why did my 10 dollar lunch turned into  a 22 dollar lunch?  So anyway I am still wanting some pizza, so I get on line and this place seems to fit the bill.  So I order a small pizza and salad.. costs less than what I would have paid at Otto's..  HELLO..  and they brought it to my front door with a smile.. so good, I just wish that I had someone to share it with..  way too much for one..."}
{"text":"Went here because of the positive reviews - I hope my experience was an anomaly, but I won't be coming back. \n\nDelightful waitress; rest of staff seemed like new hires that didn't quite understand customer service.\n\nOmelette and hash browns were uninspired, flavorless, and burnt. Ordered iced coffee, black, which also tasted quite burnt (I drink black iced coffee all the time - it's supposed to taste bitter, but this was definitely burnt). \n\nMy candid opinion- I really do hope other people have a better experience here."}
{"text":"The service is terrible, overpriced hookah that wasn't worth it. The owner was very unprofessional. Never would go there again. Actually looking forward to see this place shut down."}
{"text":"This place got lots special flavor bbt~ \nLove the Oreo green tea cheesecake and they have a few selection of savoury dishes too (curry fish balls, teriyaki rice bowl etc... Also hot or cold tofu flower dessert :D \nNice place for grab and go :) only thing is the wait is a bit long~ ordered 2 drinks on a Tuesday night at 10pm, waited 15 minutes and it's not packed busy tonight. Prepare yourself with a patient while waiting for your yummy sweets."}
{"text":"Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years.   The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories."}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH EVER. we waited about an hour to be seated, it was super busy. And definitely worth the wait  the restaurant is very compact with close tables, you get to know your neighbors very quickly. They have a coffee and waffle bar right in the front with unusual dipping sauces for the famous waffles. I had the milk chocolate lavender with a waffle  a nice treat before brunch! My hubby and I ordered the salmon fume and paella. Both were delicious! The flavors dance on your tongue this place is at the top of our list EVERYTIME were in BC! \nSalmon fume: 5\nPaella: 5\nWaffle + milk choc lavender: 4"}
{"text":"Me and The Piegon went this past Saturday around 4 in the afternoon. It was a good thing we got there when we did, because around 20 minutes after we were seated the rather small wait turned into a real Charlie-Foxtrot. \n\nThere were 40 people lined up along the small front waiting area of the joint shooting daggers at those that were already sitting and enjoying their food. The looks were those of desperation and hunger, coupled with a few who looked like they were dragged there by their wives and girlfriends because it's new and cool and would rather have said screw it and headed to Neuvo Laredo just around the corner.\n\nThe Piegon got the Butcher's Cut and I got the Flip Burger; we split the Onion rings. The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. \n\nWe actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange. \n\nWe split the Nutella and burnt marshmellow shake, it was O.K, nothing to slap family members about.\n\nOverall the experience and burgers were good and we will certainly head back over to Howell Mill Rd to eat there again."}
{"text":"Have walked past this place for months meaning to try it.  And, have absolutely no regrets about finally doing so today.  On previous occasions it looked like it had just a few customers in there but today it was half full when I got in.  My timing was perfect as within 5 mins of my arrival, the rest of the place filled up with a wide assortment of folk\n\nI ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious. Extremely flavourful and raise the roof off the top of your mouth, not blow it off, spicy. !  In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.\n\nI was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. \n\nI am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample.  I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful in an understated way.  Could not stop myself rubber necking to get a good look at how the casual yet classy ambiance  had been accomplished with a subtle colour scheme and textures. \n\nWill definitely go back and was suitably impressed to take others with me"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Been coming here for years.  The moment you walk in and sit down you immediately feel like you're in someone's persian family home and ready to eat a home cooked persian meal.  If you're more into the \"experience\" of dining out, you may be critical of this place, because they're not about glitz and glamour, they are about DAMN GOOD FOOD!\n\nThe beef kebabs always come out scrumptious, the flat bread, the persian style lentils and rice, I'm not even kidding my mouth is watering just typing this out.\n\nIt's also a very culturally interesting place to eat, because it's the only place where during any given lunch time, you can see Israelis, Arabs and Persians all eating in the same room feasting on the same delicious eatery.  Now if only we could get the entire middle east to run like this resteraunt things will be great :)\n\nBeen coming here for at least 7 years and won't stop for another 7+."}
{"text":"Best fat burger in town ( there are many types fat\/skinny\/greasy\/etc Hoppdoddy has the best Fat burger) cool ambiance, great idea ( sustainable eating) its not a new idea, but i like the way they make it easy to understand for those of us that don't usually partake. My personal favorite is the Greek burger, and the Hard Cherry Lime-aid with Gin or vodka... for dessert try the Salted Caramel shake... they also have the real sugar sodas... DEFINITELY GO THERE  :)"}
{"text":"First of all- the Staff is amazing.  Everyone is super nice and always cheery.  I usually opt for the drive thu because in the morning I'm lazy and don't want to get out of my car.  On the off chance I do go inside I feel like I'm waiting FOREVER for my order.  I almost feel like the drive thru is faster.  My advice is wait in the drive thru line- you'll get your drink faster."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars, this review is for the food not the service. Over priced NOT authentic vietnamese food. $6.5 for a banh mi (vietnamese sandwich), seriously?? hoagie bread not the usual banh mi bread and they skimp on the meat and veggie toppings. The dipping fish sauce that came with the spring rolls were salty and lack sweetness. So disappointed...The Pho (beef noodle soup) was overly spiced, my parents couldn't even finished their meals. Will not be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I recently took two of my D.C. buddies here to \"experience\" Austin. Why did I do this? Because up until my last visit there, which happened to be on a Friday morning, I have always enjoyed this restaurant. Their food is very good, and that is the only reason I have left them 2 stars. However, their hostess actually ignored me for a good 30 seconds when I walked in because she was playing 'read my lips' with someone across the room. As a customer, I found this to be disrespectful. Then she tried to seat us next to the kitchen- when I pointed to an available table on the other side of the room, she got pissy. At this point I was just embarrassed that this restaurant was going to be my guest's first impression of Austin. The drinks are overpriced and plain. I won't be going back, South Congress Cafe has become absurdly busy and pretentious...maybe South Congress in general has just lost its charm."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, Great location! We tried their veggie momos last Friday. Never had such a tasty momos. When we went there owner was actively working in the kitchen. Staff are very pleasing and friendly. Service was very quick as well. Will definitely be one of their frequent customers!"}

{"text":"Stopped here for lunch before a road trip. I had the grilled cheese and fruit bowl.  It was ok.  Nothing exciting but not horrible.\nMom got the short stack of banana nut pancakes.  She said they were good but not awesome.  Very generous portion as she couldn't finish them.\nI'll go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Yup, 5 flippin' stars. I'm just going to delve into the facts, the Szechaun beef noodle is literally THE best I've had. There was so much that I had to take the rest to go and the leftovers even sufficed as a whole meal of their own. The noodles were soft yet not soggy, the broth was...oh gosh, so good. So flavorful and comforting. It's like if your mom made you a nice heaping bowl full of love. The beef chunks were plentiful and not full of tendons like most places. It just falls apart when you eat it. Price wise, the noodles costed about 9 dollars, pretty dang good for what you get. \n\nWe also ordered the beef rolls, basically the green onion pancake wrapped around some beef and hoisin sauce. Four in an order, and trust me, you will get full off of two. The green onion pancake was nice and flaky like green onion pancakes should be, so thumbs up to RiceBowl for nailing that. \n\nI'll be back, RiceBowl. Just have a bowl of beef noodle waiting for me!"}
{"text":"I don't know but the pizza has gone down hill the last 2 times I ordered.\n\nIt was so remarkably bad that I had to order chicken fingers as a back up just in case... Glad I did!\n\nThe crust is longer fluffy and buttery deliciousness with the perfect fluffy chewy\/crispy texture.\n\nFeels like chewing cardboard... Kind of tastes like it too.... What happened?  Is it frozen now?\n\nI don't know... \n\nBut the plain chicken fingers with sauces on the side were good enough to mention... Pretty big, tender pieces of white meat, with crispy, flavorful batter.\n\nSo... If you want chicken fingers you have my permission to order them... \n\nHopefully by the time you go, they will not have changed that recipe.\n\nIf you want great, gourmet-like style pizza go around the corner to All Star Pizza Bar!  \n\nThey have huge slices, and many different varieties and fantastic flavor combos!\n\nMy friend love the Redhead, I usually just try any slice that speaks to me that day whether it's cheese, a meat option or something funky... Yes... Funky is an option and it varies daily... Way to keep us on our pizza toes!\n\nWant pizza?  Go to All Star now!!! Run, don't walk far away from here! Lol"}

{"text":"This hotel never disappoints me!! Stayed here with my wife for our 1 Year Anniversary and the package we paid for was above and beyond what we were expecting. Mira called us the morning of checkin and went over all the details in regards to our stay. Jason our driver dropped us off to dinner and was there in no time to pick us up. Jason gave us 5 Star service! My wife told me that she felt like we were out of town so that tells you how great of a stay we had. Only down side of the stay was trying to hangout at the pool. Recommend you get to the pool early if you want to have somewhere to sit and hangout. Other than that we had a true 5 Star stay!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I like it. I work very close to this place and I've only gotten their food delivered. That being said I've never dined in the actual establishment. \n\nSo far I've tried: \n\nsalad rolls: fresh and delicious with their perfectly spicy peanut sauce. \n\nTomyum: it's ok. It's a little too sweet for my taste but some people like it that way. \n\nPineapple fried rice: mmmmmmmmm, that is all.\n\nTropical cashew crispy chicken: very delicious. My second favorite. \n\nThai Smile chicken wing: OMG. The best on the menu. My favorite item here. \n\nThere's a lot of good Thai in Portland and this is pretty legit. If you go I would recommend something off of he signature house special portion of the menu rather than the usual pad Thai or curry from this restaurant because I'm sure you've found your favorites of those elsewhere and it would be unfair to judge them that way."}
{"text":"This is a good default breakfast place. There service is always very good. They have a large menu. Nothing is truly amazing here, but everything I've had is good. There is something on the menu for most people here."}
{"text":"This is a cute little gem of a cafe. For the vegan in our party they had vegan French toast, tofu scramble, and vegan sausage, while I had a ham and caramelized onion omelet. Both were phenomenal leaving us both happy. The one downside was the smash browns, but everything else was so good we overlooked that..."}
{"text":"I miss Boston Tea Stop!  My favorite stop for boba in Boston.  A cute little place just off of Harvard Square.  It's pretty small, so I don't usually stay, I just grab my boba to go.  \n\nThe bubble tea is great.  I rarely stray from my standard black or green milk tea, but here I remember really like the rose petal? or rose-something tea with lychee jelly instead of tapioca balls.  (sorry it's been so long since I've been there).  And they also have mochi ice cream which is YUM.\n\nI always try to stop there on my (now very rare) visits back to Boston!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. This has quickly became one of my favorite brunch spots.\nI have tried quite a few items and all have been awesome. \nI normally order the strawberry orange juice.\nThe staff is friendly and fast. Food comes out so quick it is scary."}
{"text":"Shame on me for taking so long to get here! I walk & notice signs saying, \"Sue says...\" I'm already liking this place. A woman takes my order & I ask if she is the famous Sue. She says, \"I'm Sue, but not I'm not famous.\" \n\nI get a hot Italian. It was perfect. I like the bun a little toasted so it doesn't get soggy with the oil. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fun hibachi style. Long wait though even with a reservation. Food was excellent. Pricing a bit high. Would recommend if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Nate, the owner, came out and looked at my house prior to the move, just to get an idea of what would be needed manpower-wise. I liked him from the get-go! Great guy, very personable. After meeting him, I knew I'd found a great company. \nI got a few estimates, and most are in the same price range. So just find a company you like, one that gets good reviews about the employees being friendly, taking care of the furniture, etc. WM Pro guys were all that. Got my 1400 sq ft house completely loaded and unloaded into the new house 45 minutes away from start to finish in 5 hours! I was truly impressed. I would gladly call them again for my next move."}
{"text":"Good donuts but for $58 worth of them I wish they could've at least had my order right."}
{"text":"Walked in and this place was beautiful staff was very  friendly, but we sat down  and in about 5 mins we saw a mouse crawl across the floor. The guy at the table next to us stepped on it and a waitress came over to sweeped it up. We read good reviews and we're looking forward to the place but had to leave ."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Not fancy.  \n\nKnow what you're going for - Noodles, Lamb Skewer, or Gyoza.  If that isn't what you're looking for, go the Asia Cafe around the corner.  Noodles are fresh, not dried.  some people like 'em, some people don't.  I do.\n\nKnow where you're going - to a noodle house.  Nothing fancy.  There is a good chance you'll be sitting at a card table.  \n\nWhile this is Chinese fare, it is the most authentic noodle restaurant I have found to date - very similar to what I use to enjoy when I traveled to Japan.  \n\nThe pancakes may be a little oily for some palettes but if you know what you're ordering, you'll likely find them to be excellent.  Be careful - they will be HOT.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb Noodles and the broth was excellent.  Fortunately, it was not too salty (something I frequently encountered when traveling to Japan).  While I generally prefer spicier fare, the flavors were excellent. \n\nI would thoroughly like to see more noodle houses - real ones, not chains - in Austin.  \n\nIf you know what you're going for, you shouldn't be disappointed.  But don't try to make it something it isn't."}
{"text":"I've come here for a couple years on Record Store Day and the service is always great."}
{"text":"The room was horrible and the customer service was worse.  To top it off, my car was burglarized overnight and no one even offered to assist with calling the police.  My advice would be to stay away from this hotel and area."}
{"text":"I called to get a toilet unclogged.     After 2 attempted the tech stated I would need a new toilet and he recommended the $1000 fix.   He said in 2-3 days it would be clogged again.    He charged us $227 and asked if he would get 5 stars for his service.    What????   I called to complain about not having value meet the mark of the amount paid.   Customer service called and said they would call back in 24 hrs.   No one has ever called me back.   Awful company!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Good selection of brews. Also, they have a Hawaiian melt that was to die for. Splurged a little and also got their truffle fries. Cleared the whole plate, and left 5 pounds heavier and happier :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly employees. The make up artists are very talented. I've had a couple of them do my makeup. I also recommend trying their smoky eyes service. I like to go to Sephora during off hours when it's not too crowded in there. Obviously the no pressure concept is working for them. I also like to support small local stores as well but one of the nice things about this place is you can browse among a lot of different brands and not feel pressured about commissions. They'll make you samples. I also like to buy products here versus some other places because you get loyalty points for doing so."}
{"text":"Next stop on our bar hopping adventure. I had never been here before, the place was super crowded for St.Patricks Day. We waited probably 15 minutes to get in but there was no cover charge so it wasn't too bad. But once we get inside, you could barely walk past anyone without touching the person next to you. I felt like we were at a rock concert in a mosh pit situation we could barely move. Even after all that fighting my way to the bar, it took another 15 minutes before I got the waitress to come and take my drink order. It was such a loud atmosphere I felt like I was screaming my order at her. Only got 1 drink here, too crowded to get to the bar again just to wait even longer. That and it was so hot inside it got to be a little h comfortable after a few hours so we left. Maybe I'd come back but not on a holiday like St.Patty's Day again."}
{"text":"Great tacos for a great price.  And they have a gluten free menu - yay!  The tacos you will want to eat again and again."}
{"text":"The first time I had a sandwich there it was pretty good, just good though! My boss picked us up lunch as there isn't' alot of eateries in this area. Well, I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. The girl that was making it had her hair in her face (not working around food appropriote. style) I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food. I shook it off and tried not to think of it. They only had two choices on their soda vending machine(ok, they are a small business) but I figured not to complain because I understand it's a small place. I paid and left. When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges. I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla, the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce...YUCK!! I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick. I threw it away. I paid $7.50 for this crappy food. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE!! \n\nPS: Wish I didn't have to click on a star...NO STARS"}

{"text":"My least favorite  of the vape shops i've been to. They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward."}

{"text":"As we are on a driving trip between Arizona and Texas, and with our dietary restrictions of no dairy, no sugars and no grains of any kind, we search for restaurants where we can have some good protein and veggies.  We picked the wrong one.  We had four in our party, and one of them picked the steak (all full of fat and gristle), one picked a salad, and the greens were wilty, another picked chicken, which was super dry, and then the service was soooo slow.  In this day in age, we recognize it's difficult to find good help, but when you tip 20%, and they make $25 per table, for example, you expect some decent level of service..not this time..we won't be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Coffee is 5 stars.. I had a Mocha and the hubby had an eggnog latte. We both ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito that comes with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were bland and dry. I ended up adding some salt and pepper to make them more edible. The burrito was just OK. Nothing spectacular about it. Would come again just for the coffee."}
{"text":"I am definitely no expert when it comes to the French experience but I have traveled extensively to France and can confirm that this restaurant has an authentic flair to it's food & service.\n\nit is a real gem in Vancouver - where the neighborhoods are lined with Sushi joints & Cactus clubs on every corner. Les Faux bourgeois is very charming and quaint, a great place to take out-of-town guests to show them how \"culturally diverse\" the cuisine is in this city.\n\nTips: Try the French Onion Soup, Steak & Frites and Florentine tart. Lastly, be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"As a native of the New Orleans area, I can tell you that this food is legit! It is delicious and amazing. crowded, but charming. Their biscuits are out of this world as is their home made jam."}
{"text":"This is only a review for the auto shop, not the gas. This is the only place I've been for an inspection sticker. They seem to know what they are doing as I have never had a problem with any inspection sticker. They are honest and all business. I even once drove from Boston because I know I can trust them."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for Lunch to an unenthusiastic hostess who sat us down on an actual bench. The entire tent is filled with long wooden tables and thus it was not a private setting. Atmosphere reminded me of being in a large, festive camping tent, but tinted brightly orange. The dish we wanted was to split the Lobster Mac and Cheese: \n-Portion: Large \n-Cheese: bit \"watery\", could be thicker \n-Lobster: Average portion \n-Was it worth $27 without adding table service? Probably not.\n\nBy the way, if you're looking for a classic Lobster roll, do NOT get it here. I saw several faces of disappointment when the waiter brought them out. These lobster rolls are definitely underwhelming and expensive! Head over across the street to James Hook for a $20 one that will at least overfill the bun."}
{"text":"I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall.  I thought I would give it a try.  Here's how the experience went:  There were 2 people at the counter when I arrived.  One person placed an order and said she would be back.  She walked away.  The other person was not making a purchase.  There were 2 young men working behind the counter.  The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him.  Two more people lined up behind me.  I asked if I could place an order.  The \"front man\" moves to the back and the other guy comes and says \"Sure.  Sorry, we're really busy.\"  I order cheeseburger fries.  The former \"front man\" puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave\/convection oven for about 40 seconds.  He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard.  He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes.  I was conflicted about what to do with the fries.  They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them!  I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall.  Please don't waste your money."}

You may regret it in the morning, but at 1:00am you will be thanking the nice drive thru man for his patience and his speedy and accurate order taking!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here tonight, so much so that I'm writing my first yelp review. It started out with the bartender being extremely rude to us for no reason. He made fun of my friend's drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling. When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I've ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager. Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again. The food was even mediocre."}
{"text":"After a review that I made about Spud, I received a week later a reply explaining the reasons why they couldn't provide us more local products.\nIt is due to the terrible weather that we are experiencing. Unfortunately they have to propose us more Californian products as California had been more lucky with he sun than we have been.\n\nI mean what kind of company answers all your question to make sure that you are happy with them ........\n\nSpud.ca, you were already a big favourite of mine, trust me now when I say that you are my hero ......."}
{"text":"After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work."}
{"text":"I love Meghan. There, I said it.\n\nMeghan's amazing for two reasons:\n\n1. She makes magic with my hair. She seems to find THE color that works well enough to get people saying 'hey, hot stuff'... okay well not quite 'hey hot stuff', but that's the way it sounds to me after I get my hair done. And if I'm thinking about making it short, oh she'll make it short, and give me the confidence to think I can actually pull it off. Which I did, thank you very much.\n\n2. She has the best personality evar. She's seriously such a delight, without being fake. She's totally honest (even admitting her love of questionable 1980s musicians who shall remain nameless). \n\nShe's so fun and I'm thrilled to be able to get a rockin' lookin' do, while having a great time, too. Can't ask for more than that!"}

It is very cozy though and the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I've only tried 1 type of sandwich, and I've inhaled it every time!\nSimply amazing! The prosciutto with red pepper.\n\nPrice: under 10 bucks for a sandwich and drink. \n\nService: Fast and efficient once you get to the front of the line.\nBe prepared to line up to order, they are making the sandwiches as fast as they can but can't keep up with the  droves of hungry peeps. Lunch time is especially busy.\n\nSelection: Italian deli with meats, pastas, sauces, other Italian delicacies\n\nSeating:Theres only 2 outdoor tables so better off going for take out.\n\nParking: Free street parking but not that many spots around.\n\nPayment: Cash, Credit Cards, Debit."}
{"text":"eat the COPPA. best thing ever. \n\nI usually get the mashed potato with gravy as my side and then my bf gets the Boss salad and we split the two plates between the two of us. The coppa is amazing but it's quite heavy so half the sandwich is perfect amount for any foodie person. Trust me.\nService is solid. They do have a 5 drink max policy. \nIf you go there often get the beer card so you could eventually get a mug."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE\n\nThe food was gross per usual. The potatoes tasted like they were cooked in dirty, rancid oil. Everything else was just bland. AND they gave me gluten-free bread (not all the bread is gluten-free) without warning me that it was gluten-free. I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.\n\nThe server was talking to her friend\/customer\/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1\/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.\n\nShe was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.\n\nThis was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again. It was just a waste of money. I work in the service industry and wasting my money on a terrible experience is ridiculous. \n\nOh, the applesauce was good."}
{"text":"The bar area had a very classic look, with lots of dark wood. The seating was elegant, with wooden chairs and white fabric table clothes.

Put a little of their pickled lettuce on top and it's delicious.\n\nI also recommend the Yucca plate if you're in a big group, and you can literally chew off pieces of Yucca (similar to a potato with a harder texture) and bacon (real meaty pieces, not strips) for an hour.\n\nIf you like Central American food, I've yet to find a better place in Texas."}

{"text":"You guys would have people lined up around the block if you would just change out those horrible floors to thick squishy awesomeness! (or at least provide super thick crash pads).  Fix the flooring and I personally would bring you five newbs easy.  I asked the staff about it and they said that they've been trying to get the owner to do it for years, but \"he's too cheap\". Reduce the risk of injury and make challenging routes more accessible = more fun, more members, more $$$.  Don't be lame like that."}

{"text":"This seems to be the sixth location in the area and is similar to the Roswell Rd location, but opened end of December 2013 and has a bit more space.  It was brand new and clean (though a few things were still being added) and fairly empty, so the kids roamed around having a good time.  They even had a dance party with a mascot for the 10-12 kids there at the time (I would have guessed they did this only for parties)."}
{"text":"this is not real mexican food...watered down salsa with a buncha salt! Cheap but not good. I got tacos and they sucked. sorry but it's the truth."}
{"text":"Lots of cute accessories for the pre-tween girl. Only buy when there is a sale - other wise everything is ridiculously overpriced. \n\nI've always had decent luck with the sales staff. Friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Like what other Yelpers have said before: What a great hideaway in Central Square! \n\nYelpers can take FOREVER to decide on a restaurant, especially with our star rating, price range, category of food, and neighborhood locale computing in our little heads. I was actually surprised that Jessika picked this place, since she hates Chinese food. But this is different than what you might usually find. The dishes actually tasted more Taiwanese than anything else I've tried before. For a party of five, we had no wait on a Friday night! \n\nShe was quite fascinated with the background of the food in the introduction of the menu. For dishes, we had the Shogo Nurmtak (appetizer) , Chhasha Curry (chicken), Langsha Duluma (beef), Langsha Momo (steamed dumplings), Gonga Deyngo (pork fried rice). All the descriptions and other choices are in menu pages, so be sure to check that out! All in all, the food was very tasty and well seasoned. It is not greasy at all and not the kind of food that you would regret eating afterwards. Darn the Chinese for their unruly occupation!"}
{"text":"We tried 3 dishes all 3 were good. Unfortunately instead of coke we got cherry coke. I'm curry there wasn't enough meat. Over all good experience"}
{"text":"This place has great service, but I won't be returning for the food. It looks like if you are going for sushi, this place is probably great, however my husband and I went for a simple general tso's chicken and a beef meal. The quality of the beef and the chicken were pretty awful in my opinion and severely disappointing for the price. I won't be returning, but the staff was great. I am sure their sushi is their strong suit."}
{"text":"This is a fairly nice place to go for a special occasion.  The atmosphere is nice and the view is grat.  It also sits at the end of a very nice walk.\n\nThe food is fairly good.  I took my wife here recently for her birthday.  I had salmon, one of their 5 version of it, in truffle sauce.  it came out almost like a fajita.  The onions and mushrooms had the nice fajita consitancy, and the salom, a fairly average piece of it, was placed on top.  The salmon alone was meh at best, but the mushroom sauce and the grilled onions and mushrooms definitely made the meal.  My wife got some opakapaka (which I later learned to some sort of Hawaiian snapper).  I tried a btie and it was one of the better wish fish preparations I have had.  I am a fan of red fish, but not too fond of white fish, however I would definitely eat it the way this was prepared.\n\nOverall a good place for a date.\n\nOn a side note in response to a couple of the reviews I read:  Seriously, who goes to a fancy (at least fancier) restaurant and expect a 24 oz. steak?  When you go to a place like this you aren't supposed to gorge yourself like a fat pig, save that for Claim Jumpers or Mexican.  You are paying for the ingredients, the preparation and the atmosphere.  If you're just looking for some ho-hum food made in a ho-hum manner in a ho-hum restaurant but in large quantities, please go to Denny's and stop soiling the reputation of decent places with your improper expectations."}
{"text":"I wanted a classy experience with some friends on Saturday night and thought that Gypsy Kitchen would be a great place to try out. It's located in Buckhead and is upstairs at the shops of Buckhead. \n\nThere is a parking garage located right beside it and there is an elevator that brings you right to the restaurant.\n\nGypsy Kitchen is a Mediterranean and Spanish influenced restaurant that features many drinks and a wide range of tapas. Great place to grab some drinks and tapas! They have a rooftop as well.\n\nI loved the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. It felt classy, yet had this Spanish feel to it that made it relaxing. \n\nWe were seating on the rooftop right away and enjoyed where we were seated. We were greeted by an amazing waiter, named Stanford, who made our experience even better.\n\nWe ordered the Rose Sangrias, which were absolutely delicious, and for food, we ordered a plate of Patatas Bravas. They were pretty simple, yet they were pretty good. I honestly think that it was overpriced though. I wasn't completed impressed by that.\n\nOverall, great place to hang out with friends or have a date night with a romantic feel to it. However, it can be pretty overpriced."}
{"text":"The fact they didn't include the \"Famous\" on here irritates me. I was a doubter but, as a beef guy, I must say the best of the bunch. Roll it out rare and tender, 3 way please. Never tried anything else and likely never will. I've tried all the others and while good they simply aren't \"Famous\""}
{"text":"The best $7 you will spend on lunch in the area! Talking about the Gyros..They put some sandwiches to shame. WOW, this thing was:\nFresh..Juicy..Meaty..Yummyyyy\n\nThis little no frills place packs the punch. I went in there after being cooped up inside with a cold and was craving something good. Even though my appetite was lacking, I put that whole thing down and felt great after! \n\nZooooo Gooood!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great the service was horrible.  Starts from the manager down.  Horrible manner and hostess was so rude!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly newer QuikTrip. Located conveniently on my way to the gym. It is nice and clean. Plenty of pumps. There is an entrance and parking on the side of the building in addition to the front. This is a great way to avoid the crowd. Prices are affordable and the pricing sign can easily be seen from the road. They sell lotto here - fyi for the gamblers. :-) The staff I have encountered are nice."}
{"text":"What is a Chinese street sandwich?  Delicious, that's what it is!  Just picture a handmade flatbread wrapping device enclosed with a chicken so lightly fried you almost think it's calamari.  Then add pickled peppers, greens and sauce.  You now have the Chicken Po Boy in your hands.  Eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing massage by Jessica. If you have any type of pain anywhere she will take care of it ! She also asks questions in regards to what you like an dislike and what you'd like her to focus on. \n She incorporated stretches and seemed to be extremely knowledgable about the body.  I was very happy that she pin pointed areas that needed work. I just booked a 2nd appointment next week"}
{"text":"Sadly I don't recall his name but I had one gentleman arrive with a very unassuming truck for my move. It wasn't complicated so I suppose that was sufficient. He was quick and efficient. The fee to move was sensible. I guess they are a new company because there was no branding on the truck and the worker didn't appear to have on a shirt identifying him with the company. He was very kind and even conversational. For smaller moves I wouldn't hesitate to use them again."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places here in Portland!!! The size portion is decent, the soup and meats are in good quality. I just wish I live close by and can come here to eat everyday."}
{"text":"They've changed their menu. They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.\n\n new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  \n\nWhen you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and I just love this place. We take all our friends out to Blue Fin for dinner; I eat lunch there 2x a month at the counter next to this lovely Japanese woman who probably eats lunch there every day. Food is fresh, sushi wonderful, people who work there very friendly. Not a fancy place , not too expensive, and a gem of a neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good and it was rated A on the state inspection app whatthehealth. \nI wanted to leave a tip but they don't accept them. They say they want you to come back and their excellent service backs the statement."}
{"text":"Clean and nice interior, service was great but food is just ok.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizer, fish cake and crunchy wonton. Fish cake tasted like it's microwaved and the wonton is bland.\n\nFor main we ordered pad Thai and shredded chicken. Probably the best pad Thai we've ever had. The shredded chicken is pretty spicy, if you love spicy food you should definitely give it a try.\n\nWe also had the coconut ice cream, we probably had a big expectation because of the reviews but we think it's just tasted ok.\n\nOverall we had a good time experience but nothing really impressed us except for the pad Thai."}
{"text":"Good frames.  Good pricing scheme.  Lenses included in frame price.  To get my annual benefit for insurance it costs more to use insurance than out of pocket.  Beautiful frames.  Especially like the limited edition frames.   No spring hinges so minus one star.  The suggestion that if you buy 5 you get one free kinda indicates that the type of clientele here isn't really me. For my 2017 benefit you'll find me at target optical. \n\nBut I love the clearish shiny opalescent blue frames.   For that I might up my price point for my 2018 FSA use. \n\nThe doctor is trendy.  Matches the store.  She is honest and kind."}
{"text":"Ok I agree with the other yelper...This place is over hyped.. I had the Roast Beef with mashed potatoes and green beans...Don't get me wrong the food is good..The roast was tender , mashed potatoes were good but they were not anything out of the ordinary.. Lacked seasoned flavor.... it taste like cafeteria food .I also had 2 rolls which were hard .I got an unsweetened iced tea & peach cobbler.. All came to total $11.86 which was over priced for this food. I would think the people praising this place also enjoy Piccadilly & SS cafeteria too because this place falls right in line with those spots....I should have went to Donnies Country Cooking which would have been less & they got baked chicken not all this fried stuff like this place has...so overall I will not come back here just because it was closer to my gym"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place!\n\nWe each had a curry plate. I had the Tikka Masala and Lawrence had the Korma both with chicken. I got mine at 'medium' spice but I feel like I should've gotten the 'hot' instead. Other than that everything was delish! I suggest the Mango Lassi as well for you mango lovers out there.\n\nOur meal was less than 30$ and we also had an order of Naan bread as well. They also have the buffet option which is $9 per person. We left very satisfied with the service."}
{"text":"I just had my Closet installed and they did not finish the job the day of the installation like they said they would. I had told them in advance that i would be leaving the state in a few weeks so i needed them to have my closet installed before then. They said not to worry that it would be done by the time i left. Well i am about to leave on my trip and they still have not finished the job. I have been calling them almost everyday so they can send someone to finish it but no call back in return. They charged my card with the job not being done, yet they cant call me back or send someone to finish the job. I am so dissatisfy with the company and will NEVER hire them again. This company does not cater to its customers needs and wants at all. I hope you guys wont make the mistake i made in hiring this unethical company who only care about taking your money."}
{"text":"Why can't burgerville get food hot?? New location in Tigard.  This is like the one in Canby.  Same cold food and seems like smaller burgers?? Anyone else?   \nThe place is clean and folks were nice.  \nLots of competitors close by."}
{"text":"This OSJL used to be just ok, and average. Once the Dedham store opened about 5 years ago, it was much better. Now FINALLY the good shipments of inventory and rather well organization have arrived to this location, right off Route 1 past the Dean Street traffic light. If in the area, stop by, otherwise go to the Dedham one. They are both great and equal."}
{"text":"We had Katherine take care of our pup while we were out of town for a few days. We went by her house and met her and some dogs she was watching at the time, and our dog just loved her and the other dogs. She sent us text and pictures updates of how he was doing. He went and played at the park and went on lots of walks. He seemed like he had a great time and came home a happy, healthy and very tired puppy! We are very glad we found Katherine and our pup had so much fun!"}

{"text":"Eh. Walked in and got a pedicure. $47 for a basic pedicure with gel seems a bit much for me.  Once I got seated, the water was lukewarm. The lady got started right away and turned off the massage chair. What the heck? Halfway through, she asked me if I wanted the paraffin treatment, which I declined. She kept asking and telling me how good it was for your feet. No thank you again for the third time. \n\nThe gel polish and paint job looks descent, though. \n\nWill go back to my standby VIP nails on IH35 and Stasney for $32."}
{"text":"This place has its mix of good and bad stylists. I think 72 (includes tip) for a haircut (above a new talent) is a little steep, but maybe that's just me. The lady I went to did an okayjob, but she cut my hair a couple inches shorter than we agreed upon. However it ended up turning out well and she was very polite."}
{"text":"ARE YOU SERIOUS? they got that beef tartare?!? yessssir, it's pretty delicious. Don't even get me started on the shakes - them shakes bring all the boys to the yard, specifically me.\n\nAll the other burgers are aiiiiiight, I'm not a big fan of putting sweet stuff on my burgers so watch out for that. The environment is pretty tight, they got that dim lighting going on so bring your woman."}
{"text":"We have come here twice and had an excellent experience both times. I work at a fine dining restaurant myself and can speak from experience when I say the service at Eddy V's is the best in Austin. You'll pay a pretty steep price, but you will get EXACTLY what you pay for. The steak is good, but the seafood is some of the best in Central Texas. If it is in your budget, I highly recommend Eddy V's."}
{"text":"Clearly The MLBPA has some taste. I definitely enjoyed my stay here. I came for a trade show and the room was built in to my cost. \n\n I thought everything about the hotel was nice. The room was nice,clean and comfy.  As almost everyone had said the TV in the bathroom was awesome. Not that I would need the TV, but since it was there I made a point of turning it on while in the shower. \n\nWe had breakfast and a working lunch during the trade show. The lunch was so so good. Tons of choices really good chicken and steak. Delicious deserts. Not your typical buffet lunch. \n\nThey have nice piano bar in the lobby, with actually decently priced cocktails. It looks a lot swankier than it really is. But still nice. The food at the restaurants are pretty good. I think they have 4 or 5 restaurants. The pool area is huge too. Top Notch. \n\nThe hotel is also really close to the Pointe, which has a movie theater and tons of places to eat and shop. They even have an awesome comedy club! So you don't have to pay for a cab or Mears to go anywhere. If you're  only in town of a conference or trade show."}
{"text":"So much fun! Perfect summer activity. They have boards, kayaks, canoes, etc. all reasonably priced for the area. Staff is local hs and college kids, but they're super polite and really helpful. \nAnd shocking for Marblehead in the summer... free parking!  Also- they have \"frequent paddlers\" discounts, if you get addicted."}
{"text":"I am very disgusted by what I witnessed at Hooters.  Today I went to Hooters for lunch.  There were at least 15-20 people of Mexican decent that walked in to be seated.  I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat\/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,. I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident. No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are!!!"}
{"text":"Best time here out of all of the Hooters...... Ended up with 3 of the girls to go out for drinks with a few friends of mine and they were all down to earth. Good times and good peeps. I recommend getting their porno wings and a pitcher of their coldest.\n\nPorno? eh?\nTranslation: XXX hot=porn\n\nEnjoy"}
{"text":"When Qdoba came to Huntington and replaced Stars (did anyone even go there?), it was pretty awesome. The food was fresh and delicious. But somewhere along the way, Qdoba lost it's way and things just aren't the same anymore. Most of the workers there seem incompetent. The food is continually getting more expensive, and the food isn't as fresh as it used to be. It is a bit pricey considering you can get a massive wrap over at Boloco that tastes better and is bigger for less. Qdoba does have some pretty good nachos, but in the Southern US you get these for free with your meal, which really sours the deal here. Qdoba is a place you can probably visit a couple of times a year and not feel too bad about it, but it's by no means great."}
{"text":"i'm a sucker for puns. any one that knows me knows its true. \ni love this place. both times i've gone have been on saturday nights when the djs were playing a sweet mix of mos def, chromeo, old school reggae, and the funky fresh stuffs.\nthe enormous room is a great time. the drinks are decent. i mean, booze in boston is expensive anyway. the bartenders a cutie and the rest of the staff handles the crowd like its no ones business. the only downfall that they have is that it takes so long to get a drink at the bar, that half of the time, my friends are out the door before i can even get my drink. other than that, great lounge, great vibes, great beats."}
{"text":"An incredible dining experience! Four of us had dinner one Saturday night and still talk about the outstanding service and food! Two people in our party have food restrictions. Our server went above and beyond to make sure we had safe meals that were still delicious. Everything is made to order, even the sauces!! I assumed I wouldn't be able to have a pasta dish because o cannot have garlic or onion. The chef was able to creat a sauce just for me! Another person in our party had the gluten free pasta (the only pasta on the menu that is not made in house) and it was REALLY good! The restaurant is small, but very cozy in a good way. It's ideal for a romantic date. Tables are very close together, but once you're seated you don't feel overcrowded. There are only 15 or so table total. Make a reservation! We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING deal for quality, new boxes. More people need to know about this place! Bought four boxes today - 2 medium and 2 large - for under $7.00!! You can't beat that with a stick! Anyone buying directly from a U-haul is nuts w\/ this place around!  Totally impressed!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Ordered plain tacos today. One Carne Asada and the other Abodaba. Carne asada wasn't great. Meat was mediocre quality and flavor was bland. Adobada was much better with great flavor and a hint of spice. Service was efficient and atmosphere good. Giving it 3 stars for now but will update as I continue to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto many times and it is always great! You can't beat their happy hour. All of their apps and pizzas are so good! We just went their for brunch recently as well and everything was delicious. I got the polenta dish and it was sooooo good. Pancetta was a little salty, but I didn't mind! I'm looking forward to going back for more happy hours and brunches soon! The service is always stellar as well."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I am all for elevating the stature of asian food to chic and trendy, but the food here was uneven. There were some hits, like the pork belly buns and papaya slaw. The tacos were also pretty good. But there were also some misses like the tea smoked ribs and chicken wings. My main objections to the ribs and wings were that they were very salty without being terribly savory. I think that this place could be even better if the owners tweaked parts of the menu."}
{"text":"Quite a noisy establishment. Service is ok but certainly nothing beyond mediocre. There were hardly any vegan options which I found somewhat baffling since this restaurant is located in a very progressive area where many educated  and  health conscious individuals live. The waitress did try to accommodate me and they had 1 entree which is true vegan. But that's it, aside from salad and sorbet. Parking is fairly good. Staff is friendly but in a very robotic and scripted manner.\n\nAfter reading the owner's reply to my comment, I felt I needed to reply. I appreciate the courteous response. I do not agree that 1\/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Kee Mao take-out and it was great. The place was very busy when I went and so it appears to be a popular place with the locals."}

{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews of this place prior to spending my money here.\n\nI couldn't even distinguish the difference in the rolls because it all looked the same!\n\nDoesn't matter what we ordered, EVERYTHING we ordered tastes the same.  It was a flavorless, bland, pasty mixture that was rolled up in dry rice and topped with fish that could have been mistaken for jerky.  The avocado was more black with hints of green.   The tempura was so dry it was actually chewy.\n\nThis place is awful.  My stomach has reached up and grabbed my tongue so as to never be assaulted in such a way again.  \n\nIn my opinion any positive review of this place has been purchased.\n\nSave your money and your tastebuds and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Just had the most tasteless meal ever.  You could not teal the chicken from the noodles in the low mien. The hot and sour soup was neither.  I don't expect the best meal ever from delivery shop but this sets a new low. \n\nLast dollar spent here!  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wanted authentic Mexican food, small restaurant but still got what I wanted.. Great service delicious food. I ordered the stake with enchilada topped with mole, beans, rice plate. With a chile relleno on the side!! Uuummmm"}

{"text":"Good food, good price, and good service.  You will always find the same staff and enjoy getting to know them.  You can also get in and out quickly if you are in a hurry, or call in a to go order that will be ready by the time you get there."}
{"text":"Super yummy food, but FYI some of it is on the sweet side. The catfish was perfect  with just the right cornmeal to fish ratio. The Mac n cheese was good, so was the cole slaw (condiment for cole slaw was sweet but on the side so you could choose how much). The ribs and pulled pork sandwich were also really good - smoky and substantial with a thick, tangy, almost pineappley sauce. We will definitely be back for more - can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Portion size is big at this location. The friend chicken nuggets is very good. Fried squid also very good. I also like their beef noodle soup. The side dishes are a hit and a miss. I had lotus root one time and I had to spit it out. I still come very often because of their generous portion size. \n\nThere is usually a long line up on weekends but it's a good place to hang out with friends as they open till really really late. \n\nRecommended bubble tea choice is oolong milk tea with pearls."}
{"text":"We loved VietRiver! We stopped just to try out some Vietnamese food without realizing what amazing vegetarian\/vegan options they had! Super bonus! My (meat-eating) boyfriend even loved the vegan \"ham\" wontons. Everything was SO good from the Vietnamese iced coffee and fresh lemonade to the Vegan Buddha Feast Soup (with veg. chicken, vermicelli noodles, veggies) and the Vermicelli Chicken Bowl. Service was great too. A definite gem! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hmmm... I would have assigned a negative star, but the system doesn't allow you to... \nThis place plain sucks... Upper case SUCKS... The food is no more than the average hot dog you get on a street, which is actually more tasteful... And better service... Service...? hmmm, what service...? Much left to be desired... This place is not at all what I had I mind when I think German village... My advice...? Go some place else...!"}
{"text":"Imani (bartender) is the absolute best! I was very pleased with all of her recommendations and quite pleased with the drinks she made.  Every time someone comes into to town we make a CowFish stop.  My last guests brought children who were served bento boxes with the cutest rice crispy\/sweetish fish treat on the side. I loved the service as well as the music!"}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken is GREAT and a good deal.  If you come at dinner time they will be taking one right off the skewer for you most of the time. The steak kebabs are great as well. The chicken pot pies are awesome but a little costly, def worth a try.  As for sides I like the mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cornbread. They all taste great but (other than the cornbread) are just a bit salty for my taste, probably not much more salty than most other take out places though. I haven't tried much else on the menu yet,. This place is a good alternative to pizza or Chinese (especially Belmont Chinese places) They have free delivery to Belmont and Watertown."}
{"text":"Vacationed in Maui last summer and this place felt so true to the island! Loved chatting with the owners about our previous trip and comparing their food to the authentic Hawaiian food we were used to. Amazing pork and fish tacos! Love the cool food truck vibe. Only bad thing is the flies around the picnic tables. Other than that, this place is definitely worth the hype!"}
{"text":"It was a nice experience. My job took us here for free with the VIP package and we got champagne. You watch a 3D film first before getting on the eye.\nOur tour guide was David and he was good."}
{"text":"This was my first time I visited one of the chain's restaurants.  Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.  This location might not be accessible to handicapped people."}
{"text":"This place used to be a decent Japanese sushi restaurant until the change of owner recently. The Japanese sushi chefs are all gone. The sushi is poorly rolled, standards at this restaurant has dropped. For long time customers like me, we taste the difference.  They think that getting some asian guys to wrap rice in seaweed is sushi. Some traditional japanese dishes are taken off the menu. It is going down the same way as Ginza. Time to find another japanese place."}
{"text":"The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want."}
{"text":"South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect."}
{"text":"Soup was too sweet, too much msg, and not hot enough to cook the rare beef.\n\nSpacious but dark.\n\nA bit pricier than other pho places.  I think around $7-9\/bowl.  They only have small or large sizes, not medium."}
{"text":"The owner, Mr. Abercrombie, was very patient  working with my changing schedule.  Our carpet is light in color and has not been cleaned in 10 years and Genesis made our carpet look new!  All of the black spots and stains were removed and the job could not have been better.  Everyone was polite and professional."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Bartaco on April 12! I took a suggestion from Southwest Airlines' magazine and had a great experience. Really unique flavors and ingredients and a cute, comfortable atmosphere. Be sure to try the wild boar or the pork belly tacos, and the CLT!"}
{"text":"We stayed here as a team for my son's soccer tournament.  The only disappointment was that there was no microwave in the room and no washer\/dryer available to wash the team's uniforms.  My husband had to drive to a laundromat to get the team's uniforms washed late at night or really early in the morning.  This was not as convenient, wish they had a washer\/dryer onsite."}
{"text":"I want to give them 4 stars, but the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had there are very specific.\n\nFirst, the good:\n1. Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.\n2. Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\n\nNow, the meh:\n1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey. That seems to be the way of it with good Italian in Boulder. They are not worse or better than anywhere else.\n\nI go several times a year. I like it. The good is way good-er than the bad. It's just not amazingpants."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a quiet romantic dinner or gathering with friends. Excellent food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Location\/Parking- Easy to find and there's a small parking lot. \nCustomer Service: Very friendly staff\nAmbience: Very quaint with few tables, but that's all part of its charm. \nFood: So far, I've tried the pork and beef burritos, guacamole and beans with cheese. All were delicious with lots of filling in the burritos. \n\nI'll be back to try the breakfast and the grilled chicken entree next time."}
{"text":"Good customer service, even on a busy day. Only reason I giving them 4 stars is because of a lack of inventory. \nI was there close to a hour trying to find the right pair of work boots. It was worth the time though. I had narrow my choices down to 2 models of what they had in my size-12. They found 1 of the models with a blemish. I didn't care since they are for work, and it was cosmetic. I walked out happy paying $65 for a pair of $200 boots. \nThis is my 5th pair of Keen boots in 8 years. Great brand, but a little pricey. That is why I am stoked about my new boots."}
{"text":"We have been here several days at Disney World and desperate for a good sit down dinner that wasn't over priced! \n\nThis place is very well priced and is a very nice.  The food was quickly made and very good!  I had the spaghetti bolognese and thought it was great.  My daughters had the kids spaghetti and cheese pizza and they were real adult versions, just smaller so it was also wonderful eats.  We order a half craft of their table red wine.  Also good.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit and prices $10-13 entrees."}
{"text":"Great place to have\/host a happy hour.  We always order from the \"bar food\" menu.  The wings and burgers are great.  Also, try a half order of the lobster nachos.  There are usually good music acts as well on Friday or Saturday.  Parking can be a problem, so get there early."}
{"text":"I had a gel manicure\/pedicure and it was the most perfect thing I've ever had. They take the time to fix any smudges and make sure the polish isn't over the nail and don't rush at all. I'll definitely be back. Also try to upgrade to a deluxe pedicure it will be the most relaxing thing you ever experience:)"}
{"text":"Really closer to 3 and half stars.\n\nMy friend and I were trying to go to Esparaza up the street, but they were closed on Sunday, so we meandered down the block to Fonda Rosa.  \n\nAlthough we were seated quickly, the service was incredibly slow all night.  Sometimes I like to have a leisurely dinner, so this isn't always a bad thing...but this was \"leisurely\" to the max.  \n\nThe food was very good.  I got carnitas (the waiter recommended them) and my friend got pollo enchiladas.  The homemade chips and salsa were (which had to be ordered separately) were gobbled up in no time.\n\nFonda Rosa is a bit pricey.  The place presents itself as a casual dining experience, but the margarita I bought was $10 and some of the entrees were over $20 (not all, some).  \n\nThis isn't the best place to just drop in to, but if I were planning a nice night out then I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"The service was very good. We had a large party and most of the dishes were very well made. A few were not spectacular. The appetizers were difficult to share with more than four people because of their presentation. I personally liked Equinox better but I would still go back. Cocktails were great."}
{"text":"I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be.\n\nI called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, \"You ever use Yelp?\" \"Duh,\" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly."}
{"text":"This store is great.  They have wonderful sales and the customer service is amazing."}
{"text":"I come here all the time as I live within minutes of this place.. and I love it. The monk who works here is very friendly and makes good suggestions for special treats to eat from the menu. I love that they make all the fake meats themselves, you can literally taste the difference! The salad rolls are super yummy. And definitely try the avocado smoothie- a tasty treat!\n\nI will mention that this is a very laid back restaurant and while the service isn't like a regular restaurant you will not compromise the quality of food. I will continue to go there for a quick snack\/ lunch\/ dinner forever!"}
{"text":"The food is great!  One of my fav brunch spots in town.  The service is always awesome, and the environment is welcoming.  A great place to meet up with friends or have a nice date night!"}
{"text":"One if the best dining experiences we've ever had. The aroma, flavors and presentation took us back to the orient style cuisine. Staff was so professional and nice starting with our waiter Joe. Every single dish was explained to what it was and how it was cooked. \nMost of the fjord was prepared with locally grown products. We are making plans for our next visit."}
{"text":"Wonton soup was quite strange. Wontons were overcooked. Egg roll had no flavor. Will never order from again"}
{"text":"When I stepped in this restaurant for the very first time, it instantly smelled of alcohol!! That raised my concerns about the place. However, have been here twice now and ordered their dosas on both occasions. The dosa was gr8, crispy with 2 kinds of chutney and a spicy sambhar. The potato mash stuffing inside the dosa was so spicy the first time around that my toddler was red in the face. The owner was generous enough to offer complimentary Gulab Jamun to calm the heat :) The jamuns were perfectly soft centered making them melt in the mouth. My husband had a to go order of Biryani on both counts, the quantity is for 2 servings but its still over priced. We tried the chicken chettinadu with nan. The Chettinadu was awesome with nicely balanced flavours, no over powering spices. The service can be be slow on weekends and be prepared to wait 45mins before your order arrives.\nOver all...gr8ly satisfied."}
{"text":"Lunch at 1:30. General Tso chicken had way too much breading.  Hardly any chicken in many big pieces. Good sauce, though. Fried rice was bland too. They forgot the sour in the hot & sour soup. Expected much better from a \"fancy\" chinese restaurant. Boy, do I miss Golden Wok. Eggroll had a bunch of pepper, kinda wierd. Not worth the premium price. Had high hopes. Disappointed."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not vegan, but my girlfriend is so we often eat at vegan places when we go out. I wasn't even hungry but thank god I ordered a vtopia club, and my girlfriend ordered the grilled Mac and cheese. \n\nI made a Yelp profile just to review this place. I just ate the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my whole life. Do yourself a favor and come try it. That is all."}
{"text":"I don't have time to haul over to Allston\/Brighton for Yi Soon bakery, so this is the perfect place for my more frequent visits to Chinatown. In addition to marbled tea eggs, this place also has homemade Taiwanese style bahtzang \/ zhong zi -- sooo delicious, probably  mostly because they are fresh! I also really like their buolo bun so much more than other bakeries' around here -- light, fluffy and the crust is moist and doesn't separate from the rest of the bun. Only tried a handful things so far but will definitely be back to taste more!"}
{"text":"These guys are great! We did two resizings - very quick no problems and great fit. I also worked with Phil on a custom piece using an old stone. He was so helpful, had great ideas on what we could do and picked out exceptional accent stones for the piece. Very easy to work with, great pricing and fantastic work. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been there multiple times, usually a man did my nails. This time it was the wife\/owner, she kept saying \"it looks good no\". I told her it looked uneven & all she did was add another coat of polish. There are still large dents & waves in my polish, it looks terrible."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with Zen Cuisine considering I worked next door to the South Congress location and frequent the Guadalupe location as well, but this was the first time I ate at the Anderson Lane location. It was New Year's Day and we found ourselves wandering aimlessly around Austin very famished. Luckily good ol' Zen was open!\n\nSo this location looks like it could be featured in a Dwell Magazine article. Kudos on the design! Love the modern wall art, hanging light fixtures and wooden beams. I felt properly hipster in there.\n\nOur food was good- like it normally is since they've done the menu makeover- but I don't know if it was because it was a holiday or what, but the staff kind of made me feel guilty for ordering sushi when their wasn't any made. Twice! If that is your trick to get me to tip more, you did an excellent job, sirs!\n\nAlso, the cashier was playing around with his smartphone while it was somewhat busy. Call me old fashion, but wait until we can't see you texting so we don't quietly judge you!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chocolate delight cake and the ricotta pie for a work event.  Based on the name and how the lady described it, it sounded like a chocolate lovers dream. It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :\/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch."}
{"text":"I walked in early afternoon, and my initial impression was very, very nice.  The salon was clean! The salon owner, Tamara, greeted us right away and was very pleasant.  The nail color selection was smaller, but I liked the fact they had a good selection of O.P.I. and Essie in all the colors that are in style right now.  Tamara did my pedicure and she was very friendly.  She even offered me tips on taking care of my nails at home in between manicures and pedicures!  I liked that she established a rapport with me right away.  By the end of my visit I knew all the ladies and they were all professional.  The prices are pretty reasonable and I like the menu of services that they have.  If you are looking for \"Official\" nail care this is your place. I will be back!"}
{"text":"the lobster raviolis were absolutely delicious but my dumb boyfriend was challenged by the waiter to eat a large pasta dish and it was gross watching him out how BIG it really was.\n\nseems like a fun place to take your family for a huge meal."}
{"text":"Nice modern-looking environment.\nMellow music.\nFriendly service.\n\nMost importantly, great food.\nMy friend had the combination fried rice. He loved it!\nI had the combination clay pot and it wasn't bad at all.\nI wish I had chosen my friend's seafood clay pot which looked amazing.\n\nYou have to try out this place. Great eat for the late night munchies."}
{"text":"Good food. I tried the sesame chicken with fried rice and the royal ginger roll. The roll was delicious. The chicken was good. Would have like more green beans to be mixed in and the sauce was a little too salty. But I enjoyed it and would get it again. The fried rice had little pieces of pineapple mixed In and that was great. It made it different from other places and gave it an added sweetness which I enjoyed. I also had the typhoon margarita and it was very good as well. It also had pineapple juice which gave it a different twist. The food took a little longer to come than I though it should (about 30 min.) but it was a Friday night and they were busy."}
{"text":"Lamberts has a great deli but if you purchase the produce make sure to use it within three days.  Same quality as the stuff at Quincy Market.  The outdoor seasonal plants tend to be more expensive than most places.  Pumpkins and Christmas trees are way overpriced."}
{"text":"This was so interesting and fun. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about all of Boston's haunted history and we got to do a little paranormal investigating at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Can you give a restaurant zero stars? Because this was by far the worst Chinese food we ever had. Granted we only split one dish and had egg rolls, so maybe we just ordered something that they do really badly, but it was terrible enough I will never give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Mojo crepes aka when it was \"blue sky\" back in the day. Solid place to boba and crepes and to hang out with friends. I like their original milk tea, however their tapioca balls are usually never cooked right only downfall. Sometimes undercooked and sometimes overcooked."}
{"text":"Divine ambiance. Red walls. Cold ones. Love music. There is no better place in the 'ville."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration.  Birthday girl got her dinner free.  All menu items delicious and service is the best.  Always try the specials - they are great."}
{"text":"Great drinks at the tequila bar! Cierra recommended awesome drinks! Fast and spunky and she totes loves her gig!"}
{"text":"We come here about once a week. Pizza is delicious and the wings are really good too. We usually eat next door at hoplandia which is also awesome. Get the Pizzatna , amazing!"}
