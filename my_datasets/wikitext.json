The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills , so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies . Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against Golden State , he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry , upon which Barry remarked : \" Listen , you better learn how to play this game . \" The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry 's rebuke was correct . Desperate to improve , he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent . Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers , and had drafted Washington when he was then the team 's GM . In truth , while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him , he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career , and was not especially attached to Washington . He was surprised by this request , however , and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization , so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills . He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington 's dedication , thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day . Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions . Newell is often seen as a kind , gentlemanly person , who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball . In private practice , however , he could be an intense , unforgiving teacher , and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally ."}

{"text":"The system of infield and outfield agriculture , a variation of open field farming widely used across Europe , may have been introduced with feudalism and would continue until the eighteenth century .

{"text":"Assessments of the mating system of this species have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations . Populations in relatively intact bushland have high outcrossing rates , but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred on average , and more variable . This has been attributed to a range of causes . Firstly , the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants , resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing . Secondly , disturbed populations usually lack an understorey , and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters ; instead , they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination . The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average , leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations ; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability ."}

{"text":"If X is any finite simplicial complex with finite fundamental group , in particular if X is a sphere of dimension at least 2 , then its homotopy groups are all finitely generated abelian groups .

The first few homotopy groups of spheres can be computed using ad hoc variations of the ideas above ; beyond this point , most methods for computing homotopy groups of spheres are based on spectral sequences ( Ravenel 2003 ) .

{"text":"In late 1833 Etty was commissioned by Williams @-@ Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children .

Although their dress is generally described as Italian , Dennis Farr 's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian , based on Charlotte 's headdress . The Italian @-@ style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th @-@ century England . The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto , widely associated with Italy , was at its peak ; likewise , the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period .
